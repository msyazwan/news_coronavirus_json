The screening is also being implemented in anticipation of increase in travel volume leading up to the Chinese New Year holidays, according to an Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) news release on Friday morning. At Singapore's sea checkpoints, temperature screening also started at noon, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said in response to CNA's queries. Singapore confirmed its first case of the Wuhan virus on Thursday evening - a male Wuhan resident, 66, who arrived in Singapore with his family on Jan 20. He is currently in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and is in stable condition. Two more people were confirmed to have the virus on Friday afternoon, including the 37-year-old son of the first confirmed case. Singapore authorities had announced on Thursday that border screening would be expanded to all land and sea checkpoints, while a travel advisory has been expanded for Singaporeans to avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located. ICA and MPA on Friday said the temperature screening will be conducted by \"healthcare assistants\", and suspect cases will be referred to hospitals for further assessment. MPA said inbound travellers and ship crew will be screened at all sea checkpoints, including ferry and cruise terminals, PSA terminals and Jurong Port. China's National Health Commission confirmed 830 cases of patients have been infected as of Thursday, while the death toll from the virus has risen to 25. Elsewhere, the virus has infected at least one person in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and the US. Traffic is expected to be heavy between Saturday and Tuesday during the Chinese New Year holidays. \"Coupled with the implementation of temperature screening for travellers, delays are expected and travellers are advised to check traffic conditions before embarking on their journey,\" said ICA. \"We seek travellers\u2019 understanding and cooperation to work with our officers on site.\" Health advisories have been put up at the land and sea checkpoints to advise travellers on the precautions they are to take, especially when traveling to or arriving from China. \"Singapore residents who need to travel to the affected areas are advised to regularly check MOH\u2019s website for updates. \"Travellers to China are also advised to stay vigilant, monitor developments and heed the advice of the local Chinese authorities while in China,\" said ICA.","summary":"SINGAPORE: Temperature screening for travellers arriving at Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints began at noon on Friday (Jan 24), in response to cases of the novel coronavirus pneumonia that emerged in Wuhan, China and which has since spread to other countries.

SYDNEY: It is too early to make a definitive judgement about how Beijing has handled the outbreak of the potentially deadly coronavirus in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China. But it is already clear that any assessment will have to take into account not just the medical side of the virus\u2019s spread. Just as important in a public health crisis is how the authorities manage the disclosure of the information about the virus within the government, and to the public. So far, the handling of the crisis seems to have underlined one of the ongoing problems with the party-state, which places a premium on the control of information in the name of maintaining stability. In such a system, lower-level officials have no incentive to report problems until Beijing allows them to do so. Under the rule of Xi Jinping, such restrictions have only grown tighter. The difficulties of managing a public health crisis have been accentuated by this one\u2019s timing \u2013 on the eve of Lunar New Year, when literally millions of people would have been coming from Wuhan, a transport hub. Any official shutting down Wuhan would also have been shutting down the new year, a time when millions of Chinese get to reunite and celebrate as a family. Beijing has already had a test run in how not to handle a crisis of this kind, when the flu-like SARs (severe acute respiratory syndrome) began spreading in late 2002. China initially delayed responding to requests for more information from the World Health Organization when the virus first appeared in southern China in November 2002. It wasn\u2019t until February 2003 that Beijing told the WHO. As late as April, Beijing was still suppressing the numbers of people who were infected. It took a courageous doctor at the military hospital in Beijing, who informed the foreign media about the true count of patients, to force Beijing to deal with the issue openly. As a result, the epidemic took longer to control, it spread further, both in China and overseas, and more people died. There was one other lesson for the whistle-blowers. No one thanked them later. Just because they did good, they did not do well. Fast forward to 2020, and it is instructive to look at what has, and hasn\u2019t, changed. From all the reports coming out of China, albeit in a haphazard fashion, the medical and public health staff has performed with the skill that you would expect from highly skilled professionals. They isolated and identified the virus quickly. But from that point onwards, the early signs are that the SARS syndrome has been at play again. In early January, eight people in Wuhan were detained for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d about the virus. The official police report said they had been spreading \u201cfake news\u201d which had harmed social stability. Various officials in Wuhan continued to downplay the spread of the virus in the opening weeks of the year. As late as Tuesday evening, the Hubei provincial party secretary and governor hosted a lavish Lunar New Year event, despite reports that many of the performers were ill. But by then, the issue could no longer be contained. With infections and deaths rising, the authorities in Wuhan issued an order on Wednesday effectively quarantining the city, no small thing given its size and importance as a transport hub in central China. It is impossible to say, but at the moment, it certainly looks that way. Richard McGregor was the Financial Times bureau chief in Beijing and Shanghai between 2000 and 2009, and headed the Washington office after.

As many as 774 people died in the SARS epidemic, which reached nearly 30 countries. At the time, Beijing built the Xiaotangshan hospital in its northern suburbs in just a week. Within two months, it treated one-seventh of all the country's SARS patients, the Changjiang Daily said. \"It created a miracle in the history of medical science,\" the paper added. The Beijing hospital, built by 7,000 workers, was originally designed only to take people who were in recovery from SARS to relieve pressure on other hospitals.

Where masks were still available, at Chinatown Point for instance, long queues formed at stores. Customers were also seen snapping up hand sanitisers and thermometers. While some shops did not know when their next delivery would arrive, having sold out a fresh batch on Friday morning, others said that more deliveries were on the way. The Ministry of Health (MOH) however said in a press conference earlier in the week that there is \u201cmore than a sufficient\u201d number of N95 masks if there is a surge in demand. Typically there is an excess of six months of usage of \u201cvarious items\u201d including surgical masks during \"peace time\u201d, MOH said. \u201cThe public need not panic.

They include a stepped-up cleaning and disinfecting schedule and issuing travel and personal hygiene advisories to employees. Both ComfortDelGro and SMRT employees have been advised to avoid all travel to Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. SMRT also said that those returning from China will undergo mandatory temperature taking. \"As a precautionary measure for our commuters, hand sanitisers are available at all MRT stations and bus interchanges,\" added SMRT. FIRST IMPORTED CASEThe latest update comes after Singapore announced on Thursday its first confirmed case, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore from Guangzhou on Jan 20. He is in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and in a stable condition, authorities said. The man stayed at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa and indicated that he had kept within the hotel vicinity. Contact tracing for his close contacts is ongoing, said MOH, adding that it has identified 46 such people as of noon on Jan 23. One of them is his 37-year-old son, who is now confirmed as having the virus. Twenty-four of those close contacts - including his eight travelling companions - had left Singapore before his case was confirmed. The health authorities in the respective countries of those 24 people have been informed and are following up, said MOH, without providing information on the countries. The ministry has quarantined 16 people and is still trying to get in touch with the remaining five contacts, it said. \"The health status of all close contacts will be closely monitored. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient,\" said MOH. \"In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status,\" it added. There have been a total of 44 suspect cases in Singapore as of noon on Jan 24, of which 13 have tested negative and test results are pending for the remaining 28, said MOH. The suspect cases are aged between 1 and 78 years old. Two of the 44 suspect cases are employees of Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa, the hotel where the first confirmed case had stayed during his trip in Singapore, said Associate Professor Vernon Lee, director of communicable diseases at MOH. The two employees had no travel history to China, he added. There is still no evidence of community spread as the suspect cases were identified early, said Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services (designate) at MOH. Singapore has formed a multi-ministerial task force to deal with the situation and expanded border screening to all land and sea checkpoints. A travel advisory has also been expanded for Singaporeans to avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located. Schools in Singapore have asked parents to declare their travel plans for the Chinese New Year weekend. Meanwhile, Singapore Airlines' budget carrier Scoot has cancelled its daily flight to Wuhan as a precautionary measure. Singapore businesses with a presence in Wuhan have also taken measures. ST Engineering, which has rail projects in Wuhan, has stopped all business commutes there. MOH said on Friday that the government has sufficient stocks of masks in the warehouses and government stockpiles. It is also working with retailers to move available stocks to the retail shops, and stocks will be available progressively from Friday, it added. On Friday, China reported that the number of people infected by the SARS-like virus had exceeded 800, with 25 deaths. The markedly higher numbers were released just hours after the World Health Organization called the outbreak \"an emergency in China\", but stopped short of declaring the situation a global health emergency. China has effectively quarantined more than 20 million people across Wuhan and some nearby cities in response to the virus, and announced measures to curb its spread nationwide as hundreds of millions of people began travelling across the country this week for the Chinese New Year holiday. Streets and shopping centres in Wuhan, a major industrial and transport hub, are now eerily quiet after authorities told residents not to leave the city of 11 million, where most of the cases have been identified. The virus, which causes respiratory symptoms similar to a cold or flu, has been linked to a seafood market in Wuhan. That market has since been shut down. The virus has spread to Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, as well as provinces in northeastern, central and southern China. Across the world, confirmed cases have also been reported in Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.","summary":"SINGAPORE: Two more people have tested positive for the Wuhan virus in Singapore, bringing the total number of cases to three, the Ministry of Health announced on Friday (Jan 24).

Most of the cases were found in Wuhan city, where the virus is believed to have originated in a market which traded in illegal wildlife. With the number of confirmed cases rising by the hundreds every day, medical supplies in the city are in short supply as people flood into hospitals waiting to be treated. At least eight hospitals in Wuhan have issued public appeals for donations of goggles, masks, medical caps and protective suits for medical workers. Alumni networks of universities in Wuhan have also posted notes on social media calling for public support. Travel in and out of the city of 11 million people has been tightly controlled since Wednesday to keep the virus from spreading. The closure of manufacturers, suppliers and distributors of medical gear over the week-long Lunar New Year holiday starting this week is exacerbating the shortages.

What is key is determining the travel history of patients, given that symptoms of the Wuhan virus are similar to the flu, said Dr Lye Tong Fong, a general practitioner at Central 24-hr Clinic Group. \"The risk factors are basically their travel history and whether they are exposed to people also with these issues,\" he said. \"It's very hard to tell based on symptoms because the ... virus symptoms are almost like flu, there is no difference.

If the patient is deemed medically stable, they will be sent to the hospital by a dedicated ambulance service, said Dr Elly. Doctors have been instructed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to call for a Singapore Civil Defence Force ambulance, if the patient is deemed to be medically unstable. Patients aged 16 years and above whose conditions are medically stable will be sent to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Emergency Department, while those below 16 years of age will be sent to KKH Children\u2019s Emergency Department. Such measures have already been put into place prior to the first confirmed case of the Wuhan virus, said doctors. \"Steps have already been circulated to all the GPs, so we all know what to do,\" said Dr Elly. According to a Jan 23 MOH circular to GPs seen by CNA, a suspect case is defined as \"a person with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of pneumonia or severe respiratory infection with breathlessness and travel to mainland China within 14 days before onset of illness\". It also refers to \"a person with an acute respiratory illness of any degree of severity who, within 14 days before onset of illness, had been to a hospital in mainland China or had close contact with a case of 2019 novel coronavirus infection\".

He reported having a sore throat while on the flight but no fever. The man developed a fever the next day and began coughing. When he went to SGH on Wednesday, he was immediately isolated, diagnosed with pneumonia and identified to MOH as a suspect case at 10pm. He tested positive for the new coronavirus at 6pm on Thursday. The man is currently in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and is in stable condition. On Friday afternoon, the ministry announced two more confirmed cases.

This includes wearing masks when unwell and practising proper hand washing, they told CNA. As of Friday, the number of suspected cases had climbed to 44, with patients aged between one to 78, according to the Health Ministry. At least 25 deaths had been reported in China as of Friday, with more than 830 confirmed cases of the virus. Cases have also been confirmed in Japan, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the United States. Below are some guidelines on how to respond to the Wuhan virus situation in Singapore, according to medical professionals. 1. DON'T PANIC Members of the public should stay calm, said infectious diseases expert Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang. \u201cBecause the Wuhan coronavirus is currently not spreading in Singapore, people should not panic and overreact,\u201d said Assoc Prof Hsu, who is programme leader of infectious diseases and co-director of global health at the National University of Singapore\u2019s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. \u201cThere is no need to stockpile masks, for example. The Ministry of Health, which has learned critical lessons from the various outbreaks that afflicted Singapore including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), will issue appropriate guidance and information in a timely manner,\u201d he added. Instead, people should keep abreast of the situation, put on masks when they feel unwell, wash their hands properly and avoid travel to Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the crisis. 2. WEAR A SURGICAL MASK Infectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam urged people to use a surgical mask instead of an N95 mask. \u201cA surgical mask works both ways. It can prevent transmission from others to you and from you to others,\u201d he said. When worn, the mask should cover the nose and mouth and rest on the chin, he added. It is important for the mask to fit well, he said. The mask can be used until it is wet inside. Once wet, it should be replaced with a new one. This means that a dry mask can be used again, Dr Leong said. He advised users to keep it in a bag without deforming it. He cautioned that drying a mask in the open could allow the germs to spread in the air. Wearing an N95 mask could be counter-productive as users might touch their faces more often from discomfort, spreading viruses on their hands, he said. 3. WASH HANDS THOROUGHLY Head of primary care at Healthway Medical Dr John Cheng said the use of anti-bacterial and alcohol-based soaps is recommended. \u201cThis is especially when coming into contact with common exchanged items such as money and utensils, and items such as handrails and lift buttons,\u201d he said. Using hand sanitisers is as effective, he added. According to Singapore\u2019s HealthHub, proper hand washing means washing hands for at least 30 seconds with soap and water. \u201cThe constant rubbing action helps soap break down the grease and dirt that carry most germs. This way, your hands don\u2019t just smell fresh, but you\u2019ll also reduce the germ count on your hands by up to 99 per cent,\u201d according to the website. The recommended eight-step hand-washing routine includes cleaning between fingers, the base of thumbs and fingernails. If there is no soap available, Dr Leong said that water alone could be effective as it can also break down viruses. 4. VACCINATIONS While there is no vaccination available for the Wuhan virus, Dr Leong said that the general public being vaccinated against influenza will reduce the risk of them from falling sick. This will reduce the burden on the healthcare system and prevent distraction from people who need attention more urgently, he added. Dr Cheng said that aside from the influenza vaccine to protect an individual against influenza-based infections, it is also important to have all other vaccinations up-to-date to safeguard your general health and immunity. These include vaccines for hepatitis A, B, typhoid, region-specific vaccines and pneumonia vaccines. \u201cThis is important especially for the elderly and immunocompromised patients,\u201d he said.

Instead, people should keep abreast of the situation, put on masks when they feel unwell, wash their hands properly and avoid travel to Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the crisis. 2. WEAR A SURGICAL MASK Infectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam urged people to use a surgical mask instead of an N95 mask. This means that a dry mask can be used again, Dr Leong said. Wearing an N95 mask could be counter-productive as users might touch their faces more often from discomfort, spreading viruses on their hands, he said. 3. WASH HANDS THOROUGHLY Head of primary care at Healthway Medical Dr John Cheng said the use of anti-bacterial and alcohol-based soaps is recommended. If there is no soap available, Dr Leong said that water alone could be effective as it can also break down viruses. 4. VACCINATIONS While there is no vaccination available for the Wuhan virus, Dr Leong said that the general public being vaccinated against influenza will reduce the risk of them from falling sick.","datetime":1579888740000,"date_time":1580045978000},{"title":"Wuhan virus: 8 Chinese nationals who were in \u2018close contact\u2019 with Singapore\u2019s first case quarantined in JB hotel","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/asia\/wuhan-virus-8-chinese-nationals-singapore-johor-bahru-malaysia-12325404","article":"KUALA LUMPUR: Eight Chinese nationals who were in \u201cclose contact\u201d with the first person to test positive for the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore have entered Malaysia and are now being quarantined in a hotel in Johor Bahru, Malaysia\u2019s Deputy Health Minister Lee Boon Chye confirmed on Friday (Jan 24). \u201cThey are now in a hotel in Johor Bahru,\u201d he told CNA in a phone interview.

Temperature scanners have been set up at the entrance of the customs area. Travellers taking the bus only have to walk past these machines as they head to the immigration counters. Mr Zheng Pei Nan, 75, was travelling from Malaysia with his family. He told CNA he was not bothered by the scanners, part of the Mass Fever Screening System. \"It wasn't inconvenient to pass the scanners after alighting from the bus,\" he said in Mandarin, adding that the family only comes to Singapore once a year. He told CNA that he was aware of the virus but was not worried because he rarely travels to faraway countries. Mr Li Jian, a tourist from Changsha, Hunan Province in China, said he did not notice the scanners at first, but lauded them as a good idea. \"It's important to protect yourself and take your own measures,\" he said. The 50-year-old, who will be travelling around Singapore and Malaysia for six days, said he was not worried about catching the virus in Singapore. \"Singapore is a developed country,\" he said. According to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, screening measures for visitors arriving by car will ready by Friday night. Those for motorcycles, lorries and trains will be rolled out progressively, said Superintendent Joe Tan, who is deputy commander of ground operations at Tuas Checkpoint. Visitors arriving by car will have to roll down their windows to allow healthcare assistants to use Forward-Looking Infra-red Radar thermometers to check their temperature, he said. Those who have a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius and above will be taken to a holding area, where a nurse will interview them about their travel history and who they have been in contact with. Depending on the patient\u2019s answers, a doctor may carry out further checks to determine whether he or she is a suspected case and should be taken to the hospital. While waiting for the ambulance, the individual will be isolated and quarantined in another room. If the individual arrived by car, their vehicle and travel partners will also be moved to a holding area and further assessment will be carried out, said Superintendent Tan. As for affected individuals who arrive by bus, the people travelling with the suspected case are not treated as contact cases until the case is confirmed, said Associate Professor Vernon Lee, director of communicable diseases at the Ministry of Health. \u201cWe will only initiate the contact tracing proper, to label someone as a close contact, if the initial suspect case turns positive and it then becomes a confirmed case,\u201d he said. \u201cFor suspect cases they are still (treated as) suspect. There are quite a number of suspect cases and we don't perform aural (ie phone) contact tracing or any other measures on individuals travelling with the suspect cases.\u201d According to an ICA news release on Friday morning, the screening was implemented in anticipation of increased travel volume leading up to the Chinese New Year holidays. Due to the festive period, travel volume is expected to increase and there will naturally be delays, said ICA. During the year-end festive period in 2019, Tuas and Woodlands Checkpoints collectively saw about 475,000 visitors per day. While there will be minimal delays for those who arrive by bus because visitors can just walk by the temperature scanners, visitors arriving by car can expect delays because of the additional measures, said Superintendent Tan. The delay will depend on how many individuals there are in the car. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to seek citizens\u2019 understanding that there will be delays because it is an additional check that has been put in place,\u201d he added. Temperature screening also started at noon at Singapore\u2019s sea checkpoints, said the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) in response to CNA queries. Singapore authorities had announced on Thursday that border screening would be expanded to all land and sea checkpoints, while a travel advisory has been expanded for Singaporeans to avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located. Health advisories have also been put up at the land and sea checkpoints to advise travellers on the precautions they are to take, especially when traveling to or arriving from China. Singapore confirmed its first case of the Wuhan virus on Thursday evening - a male Wuhan resident, 66, who arrived in Singapore with his family on Jan 20. He is currently in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and is in stable condition. Two more people were confirmed to have the virus on Friday afternoon, including the 37-year-old son of the first confirmed case.

The pathogen appears to be a new strain of coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause diseases such as the common cold and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds in mainland China and Hong Kong between 2002 and 2003. It has been named \"2019-nCoV\". Arnaud Fontanet, head of the department of epidemiology at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, told AFP that the new strain was 80 per cent genetically identical to SARS. The symptoms caused by the new virus appears to be less aggressive as compared to SARS, according to an AFP report. These include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. However, its milder nature can also cause alarm as it allows more people to travel further before symptoms can be detected, the director of the Institute of Global Health Antoine Flahault said. The virus was first detected at a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has been shut down by authorities following the outbreak. The market offered exotic wildlife for sale, including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game, AFP reported. Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined. Two studies from China indicated that bats are the likely origin, as the strain was found to be closely related to a strain that exists in the animal. \"Bats being the native host of the Wuhan CoV (coronavirus) would be the logical and convenient reasoning, though it remains likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans,\" the researchers from several institutions in China wrote in a paper. Another study identified snakes as a possible intermediate host. Animals have been determined as the source of the virus, but human-to-human transmission of the virus is \"affirmative\", top Chinese expert on infectious diseases Zhong Nanshan told state broadcaster CCTV. It has since been passed to people who have had no contact with the market where the virus first broke out. Doctor Nathalie MacDermott of King's College London told AFP that it seems likely that the virus is spread through droplets in the air from sneezing or coughing. There is currently no vaccine for the virus. Members of the public have been advised to take steps to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes wearing masks when experiencing respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing, and observe good hygiene practices, like washing their hands frequently. They should also avoid places and close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness. Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Health has issued an advisory asking travellers to avoid contact with live animals and consuming raw and undercooked meat. Those who are feeling unwell should also seek prompt medical attention, it added. More than 800 people have been infected with the coronavirus in China, with at least 26 fatalities reported. Most of the patients came from Wuhan, where the virus started. It has since spread to other major cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Transport in and out of Wuhan have ceased operations in an effort to prevent and control the spread of the virus. Authorities have also locked down several cities in Hubei province as a response to the outbreak. Entertainment venues such as Shanghai\u2019s Disneyland park, theatres and karaoke bars have also been closed down. Hubei province authorities also said they were calling off cultural performances and public cultural venues. Travel agencies in the province have suspended business and the government has announced that refunds would be given to those who cancel transport tickets. Beijing has also cancelled Chinese New Year holiday gatherings at temples. The first case of the virus reported outside of China was on Jan 13, when a Chinese woman was diagnosed with mild pneumonia after returning to Thailand from Wuhan. Another case was confirmed in Japan the next day. So far, there have been confirmed cases in nine countries outside of China. Thailand has the most reported cases, at four. Singapore reported its first case on Jan 23 \u2013 a 66-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on Jan 20 and stayed at Shangri-La\u2019s Rasa Sentosa Resort. He reported symptoms such as a sore throat and fever and went to Singapore General Hospital, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and identified as a suspect case. He was confirmed to have been infected by the virus on Jan 23. Contact tracing has been initiated to identify people who may have had close contact with the man. Two other cases have since been confirmed, one of which is the man\u2019s 37-year-old son. Border screening has been implemented in several countries, including Singapore, as a response to the outbreak. Budget carrier Scoot has cancelled its daily flight to Wuhan and schools across the island have asked parents to declare their travel plans for the Chinese New Year weekend.","summary":"SINGAPORE: A new strain of coronavirus has infected hundreds of people in China and overseas, killing more than 20 people since it was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan earlier this month.

The contagion has so far claimed 26 lives in China, sickened hundreds and has spread across several Asian countries as well as the US. \"I'm pleased to report she is clinically doing well and is in stable condition,\" said Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health of the new patient. Nancy Messonier, senior official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the agency had so far tested 63 samples from patients across 22 US states for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Eleven were found to be negative and two positive, and the CDC was working to make diagnosis kits more nationally available. At present the testing is occurring at the agency's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. The Chicago patient had travelled to Wuhan in late December before returning to the US on Jan 13, Arwady said, a few days before health screenings began at major airports for travellers originating from the central Chinese city that is at the centre of the outbreak. She began experiencing symptoms and called her health care providers, and was later admitted to hospital and placed in isolation. \"She has not taken public transportation, have not attended any large gatherings and, she has not had extended close contact with anyone outside her home since returning from China,\" added Arwady.

Few flights were available to the city. \"This year we have a very scary Chinese New Year.

He said a prolonged shutdown should not pose food-shortage problems because many Chinese had stocked up for the holiday. Besides Wuhan, 12 smaller cities nearby have battened down the hatches, with most announcing measures Friday that include closing public venues, restricting large gatherings and halting public transportation, as well as urging citizens not to travel.

In Beijing, staff in full-body protective suits were seen Friday checking the temperatures of people entering a subway station. Thermal cameras also scanned passengers arriving at Beijing's West Railway Station. Beijing has been praised for its response in contrast to SARS, when it took months to report the disease and initially denied WHO experts any access. Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, asked China's people to forego New Year gatherings this year and confine themselves at home until the all-clear.

SEOUL: The website of South Korea\u2019s public health authority currently features an image of a smartly dressed woman and man wearing masks while posing in front of a mishmash of signboards written in Chinese characters. In depicting two people who are remaining calm while exercising caution as a new coronavirus afflicts the country and businesses and families brace for disruption, the government appears to be telling its people: Do not panic but do wear a mask. Next to the photo is a message imploring all South Koreans to take part in efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus, a mysterious new illness in the country. While the government is calling on the country as a whole to work to keep South Korea safe, this latest health scare underscores the reality that in this country, it is still the government that is responsible for management during challenging times. South Korea this week reported two cases of the new coronavirus that appears to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has also been reported in Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Japan. The number of cases in China grew to more than 800 this week, raising fears of a global pandemic, with even the US reporting a case. In an unfortunate bit of timing, while South Koreans are fretting over the disease this week, the country announced its weakest economic growth since the global financial crisis of a decade ago. Of late, South Korea\u2019s export-dependent economy has dealt with tremors from the trade conflict between the United States and China, as well as the country\u2019s own spat with Japan. In announcing the weak growth figures, a central bank official highlighted how the new coronavirus could pose a risk to consumption as happened in 2015 when there was an outbreak of the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in the country. South Korea\u2019s economy ought to be less vulnerable than ever to a public health crisis, as there are now ways for businesses to maintain operations with workers not being in the same physical space. This is a country with some of the most widely available Wi-Fi connection anywhere in the world, meaning that it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for workers to be just as productive from home. But despite having the technological infrastructure, South Korea has generally been slow to adapt to workplace evolutions like remote working. The country\u2019s traditions of collectivism still posit that all members of a team should, whenever possible, be together in the office for the whole day. Someone who suggests that they would prefer to spend the day at home by themselves than in the office with the team might be seen as selfish or anti-social. Beyond trust or perception issues, there is a deeper problem of a risk-averse culture in South Korea that deters employers from taking such bold moves. If South Korea seems risk averse, part of this may be explained by the country\u2019s national psyche. Having fought a destructive civil war in the early 1950s, many Koreans were left feeling that the country got a late start and had to work harder than others to develop. Having built a successful economy, Korean policymakers sometimes fear potential blowback from risky moves. That thinking is also extended to organisational cultures, where newer additions such as flexible work arrangements and remote working are deemed contrarian to and may dilute the ethos of a strong work ethic built into the national psyche. I remember years ago one successful Korean businessman telling me over dinner, \u201cYou in the West had a head start on us. We lost our country once. We cannot lose it again.\u201d That risk averse mind-set also extends to the government, which has been facing criticism for stifling innovation. A telling example is the case of Tada, a ride-sharing service. The country\u2019s large and vocal taxi lobby successfully pushed the government to enact legislation that would ban Tada from operating, arguing that the company could push traditional taxis out of business. To many, the case of Tada sent the message that the Korean government is more interested in protecting vested interests than in promoting innovation. This week, in a case local media dubbed \u201crevenge of the nerds,\u201d a group of tech entrepreneurs launched a political movement with the hope of pushing through regulatory reform that would create conditions for innovation. The founders describe being frustrated at the government who promise to ease red tape, then fail to follow through. According to one founder, South Korea has missed out on chances in cloud, big data, drones, autonomous driving, blockchain and sharing-economy technology because of the regulations. That perception of an indecisive government was also reienforced during the last epidemic outbreak in South Korea \u2013 MERS in 2015. Many here are making comparisons with that episode to question if things will be managed better this time around. The South Korean public was critical of the government in 2015 for bungling its response to the outbreak by failing to properly implement quarantine measures and not sharing information transparently with the public. Still, even though 36 people died out of 186 reported cases, MERS never snowballed into the full-blown pandemic many feared, but the uncertainty surrounding the ailment took a toll on South Korea\u2019s economy, leading to steep drops in travel and many forms of consumer spending. This time around, the country\u2019s public health authorities appear to be more decisive in taking steps to manage the risk of contagion. Airports and seaports have announced stepped-up screening measures, with separate procedures for flights from Wuhan. But that boldness and decisiveness from the government must extend wider. In times of crisis in South Korea, it is the government that is expected to lead. South Koreans look to official institutions for guidelines, and if things don\u2019t go well, it\u2019s the government that gets the blame. Similarly, businesses and organisations will also be looking to signals from the government in implementing working arrangements to contain the risks to the workforce and the economy. Ironically, the outbreak of this virus may provide the government with an opportunity to ease flexible working arrangements into the workplace culture in South Korea. That may not be a bad thing in taking a step towards a more innovative and risk-taking culture overall. More pressingly, if the South Korean government is serious about not letting the Wuhan virus take a significant hit on its economy, then implementing business continuity processes is a crucial step that has to come sooner rather than later. During MERS in 2015, the slow response and lack of transparency by the government saw measures to contain the virus such as school closures and making public the list of hospitals affected with cases carried out almost a month after the first case in May. Even then, without any clear signal from the government and lax isolation or quarantine measures, few companies implemented business continuity processes to isolate their staff from the risks. In the coming days, we will find out how much the South Korean government has learned from the experience with MERS. Yesterday, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from the government, the kind of text they send out when monsoon rains create risk of flood, or when air pollution rises to dangerous levels, imploring everyone to wash their hands, cover their mouths when coughing, and yes, wear a mask. I hope to receive another such government alert soon that advises employers to take the necessary steps to protect their business processes, including allowing their staff to work from home.

The South Korean public was critical of the government in 2015 for bungling its response to the outbreak by failing to properly implement quarantine measures and not sharing information transparently with the public. This time around, the country\u2019s public health authorities appear to be more decisive in taking steps to manage the risk of contagion. Similarly, businesses and organisations will also be looking to signals from the government in implementing working arrangements to contain the risks to the workforce and the economy. Ironically, the outbreak of this virus may provide the government with an opportunity to ease flexible working arrangements into the workplace culture in South Korea. More pressingly, if the South Korean government is serious about not letting the Wuhan virus take a significant hit on its economy, then implementing business continuity processes is a crucial step that has to come sooner rather than later. During MERS in 2015, the slow response and lack of transparency by the government saw measures to contain the virus such as school closures and making public the list of hospitals affected with cases carried out almost a month after the first case in May. Even then, without any clear signal from the government and lax isolation or quarantine measures, few companies implemented business continuity processes to isolate their staff from the risks.","datetime":1579950180000,"date_time":1580046053000},{"title":"Wuhan virus: Malaysia confirms first 3 cases; all patients related to Chinese national who was Singapore's first case","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/asia\/wuhan-virus-malaysia-confirms-first-3-cases-all-patients-related-12331172","article":"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia on Saturday (Jan 25) said it had confirmed three cases of coronavirus infection, the first in the Southeast Asian country. Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said the three individuals infected were related to the 66-year-old man that was confirmed by Singaporean health authorities to have tested positive for the virus. On Friday, Malaysia\u2019s Deputy Health Minister Lee Boon Chye said eight Chinese nationals who were in close contact with the first person to test positive for the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore had entered Malaysia and were being quarantined in a hotel in Johor Bahru. The three infected patients are now being monitored at the Sungai Buloh hospital in Kuala Lumpur. \u201cThe three here are the wife, 65, and two grandchildren (ages 2 and 11) of the man tested positive in Singapore,\u201d said Dr Dzulkefly.

The newly identified coronavirus can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. It is still too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. On Saturday, authorities in China announced the number of cases had surged to nearly 1,300 - the majority of which were in Hubei. Health officials in the province also revealed that 15 new deaths took place in Wuhan, bringing the total number of fatalities to 41 since the outbreak began. The disease has spread to 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Wuhan and 13 other cities in Hubei have been locked down in an unprecedented quarantine effort aimed at containing the deadly respiratory contagion, which has spread to several other countries.","summary":"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia on Saturday (Jan 25) said it had confirmed three cases of coronavirus infection, the first in the Southeast Asian country.

The country's most important celebration has been all but cancelled for some 56 million people as authorities expanded travel bans in central Hubei province, now affecting 18 cities. On Saturday, when they should have been celebrating, citizens of Wuhan stood in line at a pharmacy to buy masks from employees in full-body protective suits and surgical gloves. On the eastern outskirts of Wuhan - Hubei's capital and the source of the previously unknown 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) - police manning a roadblock turned away a handful of vehicles trying to exit the city. \"Nobody can leave,\" an officer told AFP. But the police allowed some medical workers who had gone home for the holidays to re-enter the city to help at overwhelmed hospitals. \"They need us to go there, otherwise they will be too exhausted,\" said one of the women, pulling a suitcase. But the respiratory contagion continues to spread. The nationwide death toll has jumped to 41, the government said Saturday, after 15 more people died in Wuhan. Confirmed infections also surged to 1,287, up from 830 reported 24 hours earlier. Most of the deaths and overall cases have been in Hubei. In a dramatic escalation of the central government's involvement, China deployed 450 military medical staff to Wuhan, state media said. The medics, who arrived on military aircraft late Friday, include doctors with experience combating SARS or Ebola and will be dispatched to hospitals that are reportedly short on beds due to a crush of infected patients and worried locals. The National Health Commission also ordered nationwide measures to detect people carrying the virus on planes, trains and buses across the country. \"Everyone is just trying to protect themselves,\" said a man in a surgical mask at a Wuhan pharmacy where customers were stocking up on masks, gloves and disinfectant. But the man, who declined to give his name, expressed confidence in Chinese authorities. \"The government is handling this. It's not a problem.\" The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003 and spread to a number of other countries. It has now spread nationwide and to a dozen other countries, with France saying three cases had been confirmed there - the first known European infections. Australia and Malaysia on Saturday became the latest countries to confirm infections. Beijing's Forbidden City, Shanghai Disneyland, and a section of the Great Wall are among many attractions that have closed as a precaution. The New Year is usually a joyous occasion for family reunions, but not for many in Wuhan. \"Usually we celebrate as a family. Now, because of the virus I'm not even visiting my parents,\" said Wang Fang, a 49-year-old Wuhan native. \"It'll be great just to be able to make it through (the outbreak).\" China's aggressive response has won praise, especially compared to its handling of SARS, when it was accused of reacting sluggishly and stonewalling the international community. \"China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,\" US President Donald Trump tweeted, hours after the United States confirmed its second case. \"The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency,\" he added. \"It will all work out well.\" China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! The virus emerged at a bad time for containment, with hundreds of millions of Chinese rushing home for the holiday. The timing could limit the economic impact, however, since much of China normally shuts down anyway during the roughly week-long break. The outbreak emerged in late December, traced to a Wuhan seafood and live animal market that sold a vast range of exotic animals and other bushmeat. The World Health Organization on Thursday stopped short of declaring a global emergency, which would have prompted greater international cooperation, including possible trade and travel restrictions. Wuhan resembles a ghost town due to the clampdown, but hospitals bustled with worried patients being screened by staff wearing full-body protective suits. The city's Guiyuan Temple is normally thronged for the Lunar New Year with tens of thousands of devotees paying respects to a deity associated with wealth. But police manning a roadblock on Saturday turned away AFP journalists, saying the temple was closed to prevent the virus's spread.

The announcement came as city leader Carrie Lam faced criticism in some quarters over her administration's response to the crisis. Of the five people who have tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong so far, four arrived via a newly built high-speed train terminal which connects with the mainland. That led to calls from some medical experts and politicians to limit, or even halt, arrivals from China, the epicentre of the outbreak with 41 people dead. Lam held emergency meetings with health officials on Saturday morning after returning from Davos. \"Today I declare the lifting of the response level to emergency,\" she told reporters. Schools and universities, which are currently on a Lunar New Year break, would remain closed until Feb 17, Lam said. All mainland arrivals to Hong Kong will now need to sign health declaration forms, she added, while public events including a new year gala and next month's marathon, would also be called off. \"We haven't seen serious and widespread infections (in Hong Kong), but we are taking this seriously and we hope to be ahead of the epidemic,\" Lam said. Hong Kong has a recent experience of deadly viral outbreaks. Nearly 300 people were killed by SARS in 2003, a tragedy that left a profound psychological impact on one of the most densely populated places on earth. The city's ability to combat the crisis was hampered by moves in mainland China to cover up and play down the outbreak, leaving a lasting legacy of distrust among many Hong Kongers. Animosity towards the mainland has intensified in recent years as Beijing tightens political control over the semi-autonomous territory. The outbreak also comes at a sensitive time for Lam, who currently boasts record low approval ratings after seven months of pro-democracy protests. \"We must stand united so that we can prevent and control the disease,\" she said, in a nod to the political unrest. The often violent protests have battered Hong Kong's reputation for stability and helped tip it into recession, with the recent virus outbreak compounding the city's economic woes. Hospitals are already struggling with the winter flu season, but officials are isolating anyone with a history of travel to central China and those exhibiting respiratory tract infections that look similar to the virus. So far some 300 people have been tested and monitored for the virus. Quarantine centres have been set up in remote holiday parks for anyone found to have come into close contact with people who tested positive. On Saturday, officials announced a newly built but still-empty public housing block would be used for medical staff on the frontline who did not want to risk returning to their families.","summary":"HONG KONG: Hong Kong on Saturday (Jan 25) declared the outbreak of a mystery virus as an \"emergency\" - the city's highest warning tier - as authorities ramped up measures aimed at reducing the risk of further infections spreading.

An empty bus was allowed to pass the roadblock into Wuhan after showing documentation to the police at the roadblock. Three young nurses who crossed the barrier on foot told AFP they were going to two hospitals. Two of them were waiting for a friend to pick them up. \"We went to our hometowns for holidays before the ban on transportation, but because of the epidemic we have to come back quickly to Wuhan,\" said one. Dragging wheelie cases behind them, they were holding their coat hoods up against the rain. \"They need us to go there, otherwise they will be too exhausted,\" another medical worker who didn't want to be named told AFP. In the city centre, temples were closed and holiday festivities cancelled, but people gathered instead in pharmacies to buy medical supplies. At one store, customers queued at the cash register while staff in protective gear retrieved what they needed and brought it out to them. Pharmacy staff were in full body suits and gloves, wearing two sets of face masks. People rifled through boxes of face masks, comparing different makes and models. Full body suits had already sold out. Amid fears of rising prices and lack of products, some sales were being restricted and officials were regulating sales. \"My duty is to supervise the price of what pharmacists are selling,\" said Li Xiang, a market supervisor at one pharmacy. \"Goods must be from official channels and prices shall not be hiked.\" Li told AFP that the government was making an effort to \"maintain social stability and safeguard people's lives.\" A popular traditional Chinese medicine for treating fevers was being restricted to only two boxes per person to manage high demand. A local radio station played in the pharmacy ran an advert reminding people to wear a mask. \"Everyone is just trying to protect themselves,\" said one man in a surgical mask who declined to give his name. \"The government is in control of this. It's not a problem,\" he added. Meanwhile, in a taxi, a rap song playing on the radio echoed the patriotic fervour, telling people not to be afraid of the virus. \"Wuhan people are strong enough to fight and defeat it,\" the rapper chanted.","summary":"WUHAN: Police at a roadblock on the outskirts of Wuhan turned away cars trying to leave the virus-stricken city on Saturday (Jan 25), as other anxious residents trapped inside spent the Chinese New Year stocking up on masks and medical supplies.

China also announced further transport restrictions. With more than 1,400 people infected worldwide, most of them in China, Hong Kong declared a virus emergency, scrapped celebrations and restricted links to mainland China. Australia confirmed its first four cases on Saturday, Malaysia confirmed four and France reported Europe's first cases on Friday, as health authorities around the world scrambled to prevent a pandemic. The United States is arranging a charter flight on Sunday to bring its citizens and diplomats back from Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the epicentre of the outbreak, the Wall Street Journal reported. In Hong Kong, with five confirmed cases, the city's leader Carrie Lam said flights and high speed rail trips between the city and Wuhan will be halted. Schools in Hong Kong that are currently on Chinese New Year holidays will remain closed until Feb. 17. Xi held a politburo meeting on Saturday on measures to fight the \"accelerating\" outbreak, state television reported. As of 8pm local time on Saturday, the death toll in China had risen to 42, authorities reported. Some 1,372 people in China had been infected with the virus - traced to a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. The virus has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, and the United States. In Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, officials appealed for masks and protective suits. \"We are steadily pushing forward the disease control and prevention ... But right now we are facing an extremely severe public health crisis,\" Hu Yinghai, deputy director-general of the Civil Affairs Department, told a news briefing. The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. Ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing said it was halting inter-city services to and from Beijing from Sunday, while the capital will also stop running inter-province shuttle buses. State broadcaster CCTV, citing an announcement from China's tourism industry association, said the country would halt all group tours, both at home and abroad, from Monday. Wuhan said it would ban non-essential vehicles from its downtown starting Sunday, further paralysing a city of 11 million that has been on virtual lockdown since Thursday, with nearly all flights cancelled and checkpoints blocking the main roads leading out of town. Authorities have since imposed transport restrictions on nearly all of Hubei province, which has a population of 59 million. Australia confirmed its first four cases in two different cities on Saturday, and the country's chief health official said he expected more cases as Australia is a popular destination for Chinese tourists. State-run China Global Television Network reported on Saturday that a doctor who had been treating patients in Wuhan, 62-year-old Liang Wudong, had died from the virus. US coffee chain Starbucks said it was closing all its outlets in Hubei province for the week-long Chinese New Year holiday, following a similar move by McDonald's in five Hubei cities. Workers in white protective suits checked temperatures of passengers entering the subway at Beijing's central railway station on Saturday, while some train services in the eastern Yangtze River Delta region were suspended, the local railway operator said. There are fears transmission could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel during the holiday, although many have cancelled their plans. Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of such screenings. In an illustration of how such efforts could miss cases, doctors at a Paris hospital said that two of the three Chinese nationals in France who have been diagnosed with the virus had arrived in the country without showing symptoms. The World Health Organisation this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency. A report by infectious disease specialists at Imperial College, London on Saturday said that despite this, the epidemic \"represents a clear and ongoing global health threat\" adding: \"It is uncertain at the current time whether it is possible to contain the continuing epidemic within China.\" While China has called for transparency in managing the crisis, after cover-up of the 2002\/2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome spread, officials in Wuhan have been criticised for their handling of the current outbreak. In rare public dissent, a senior journalist at a Hubei newspaper run by the ruling Communist Party called on Friday for a \"immediate\" change of leadership in Wuhan on the Twitter-like Weibo. The post was later removed. Hubei province, where authorities are rushing to build a 1,000 bed hospital in six days, announced on Saturday that there were 658 patients affected by the virus in treatment, 57 of whom were critically ill.

The epicentre of the SARS-like virus is in central China, but it has spread to other regions, prompting authorities as far as the nation's northern capital to close tourist attractions and cancel public events to prevent further contagion from a disease that has killed dozens and infected more than 1,000. Authorities even decided to stop long-distance bus services to and from the capital of 20 million from Sunday as part of efforts to control the spread of the virus, state media reported. Security guards loitered in front of Beijing's Lama Temple on Chinese New Year, shooing away anyone who lingered for too long.

Wearing a white surgical mask, Li told AFP she had planned to burn incense at Lama Temple, before realising it was closed. In the capital of 20 million, where health authorities have reported at least 39 infected patients, famous landmarks were closed to prevent the virus from spreading, including the historic Forbidden City and a section of the Great Wall. The Ming Tombs and Yinshan Pagoda are also not open to visitors. Beijing Ditan and Longtan Temple Fairs - held for roughly three decades according to state media - were also cancelled. In central Hubei province, where the majority of cases have emerged, more drastic measures were taken: travel restrictions have been imposed in cities housing 56 million people. \"When we left home, it (the virus) wasn't that serious yet,\" said a 40-year-old woman, who arrived in Beijing from southern Guangdong province before the closures began. \"I am worried, but I also feel like worrying too much is useless,\" she added. \"It's better to face it head-on.\" At a shopping district near Beijing's Houhai lake, where tourists buy street food and souvenirs, many restaurants were open on the first day of Spring Festival. The narrow streets were festooned with red lanterns and Chinese flags, while food stalls sold snacks like stinky tofu and sugar-coated fruit. But there were fewer people than normal, pointed out Huo, a 63-year-old Beijing native who only offered his surname. \"There's definitely an impact (from the virus),\" he said. \"Look at how few people there are.\" But when asked whether he was worried about the virus, Huo remained nonchalant. \"In 2003, SARS was much worse,\" he told AFP, referring to an outbreak that killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong. \"I don't have to wear a mask because everyone else is,\" joked another man, who had travelled from eastern Shandong province. \"There's no point in worrying,\" he added. Some tourists also felt they had no choice but to go through with travel plans to Beijing despite the closures and risk of infection. At the upscale Taikoo Li shopping district, a 26-year-old woman said her hotel refused to refund her booking. \"Some people are over-panicking,\" she told AFP, explaining that some friends were worried about getting infected, even while staying at home. \"The atmosphere is a bit tense this year,\" agreed another woman, a 47-year-old who gave her surname as Zhang.

The man, who had not displayed any symptoms of the Wuhan virus during his flight to Singapore, had stayed at Village Hotel Sentosa after his arrival. However, he developed a cough on Thursday and went to the SKH Emergency Department the following day, where he was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated. Subsequent tests confirmed the Wuhan coronavirus infection at about 9.30pm on Saturday. MOH said it has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify those who had close contact with him.

Three cases of the virus have been confirmed in France while Chinese authorities have said the death toll there has risen to more than 40 with around 1,300 infected. The French firm, which makes brands including Peugeot and Citroen, said in a statement the evacuation was being \"implemented in full cooperation with the Chinese authorities and French consulate general\" and involved 38 people made up of staff members and their families working in the Wuhan region. They would be quarantined in the city of Changsha, around 300 kilometres (180 miles) from Wuhan where the virus originated, before being allowed to return \"to their countries of origin\", the company said in a statement. The first cases to be confirmed in Europe were announced by French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn on Friday. Others were \"being monitored\", said Paris emergency service chief Pierre Cali, without giving an exact figure. \"We are going to have patients suspected of having the virus, there are going to be (more) cases,\" warned Yazdan Yazdanpanah, head of infectious diseases at Paris's Bichat hospital where two of the three cases were being treated. Yazdanpanah said they were a couple from Wuhan, a man aged 31 and a woman aged 30, who arrived in France on January 18 as part of a trip. The other case involved a 48-year-old man, originally from China, who returned to France on January 22 after having \"passed through Wuhan\", according to Buzyn. He has been in hospital in the southwestern French city since Thursday after contacting doctors with a high temperature and a cough. \"Ten to 15 people\" who had been in contact with him had come forward, Bordeaux mayor Nicolas Florian said, adding that Chinese New Year festivities planned for Sunday had been cancelled by organisers \"as a precaution\". An in-depth investigation into the three cases was launched which identified all those who had had close contact with the three patients to ensure that they were properly monitored to prevent the spread of the virus, French health ministry officials said.

Fifteen more people have died and at least 688 new cases of the coronavirus have now been confirmed, according to the National Health Commission. Among the new deaths, 13 were in Hubei, the province at the heart of the outbreak, while Shanghai reported its first death. Chinese authorities have so far reported 1,975 cases nationwide. President Xi Jinping warned on Saturday that China faced a \"grave situation\" as authorities raced to contain a respiratory illness that has caused the widespread abandonment of Chinese New Year celebrations nationwide and overwhelmed health facilities in Hubei. The contagion remained centred on the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan, which accounted for seven of the new deaths and 46 of the new confirmed cases, said the Hubei Health Commission. Wuhan and more than a dozen other cities in the province have been locked down in a rapidly expanding quarantine effort marked by transport shutdowns and other restrictions on movement. A second major Chinese city is set to halt long-distance buses as China scrambles to contain the deadly virus. Starting Monday, Tianjin - a city of about 15 million inhabitants - will suspend long-distance buses and chartered buses that enter and leave the city, local officials said on their official Twitter-like Weibo account, a day after Beijing announced a similar measure. China also announced a partial lockdown in the southern city of Shantou, the first such measure taken outside the epicentre of the disease. From midnight, non-emergency vehicles will be prohibited from entering the city of 5.6 million people, which is a 1,100-kilometre drive from Wuhan, the heart of the epidemic. People arriving at Shantou train stations will be screened and \"urged to return\", said city authorities. Buses, ferries, public transport and taxis will be suspended, Shantou authorities said on their official social media account. The measures are to \"spare no efforts in doing a good job of preventing and controlling\" the epidemic, Shantou officials said, and to \"cut off the channels of spreading the virus\". The previously unknown virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) pathogen, which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. It also has struck at possibly the worst time for China, when hundreds of millions of people are travelling across the country or overseas to celebrate the Chinese New Year holiday, China's most important festival. Instead of New Year revelry, Wuhan has been seized by an eerie calm that deepened on Sunday as new restrictions banned most road traffic in the metropolis of 11 million. Loudspeakers broke the silence by offering tips slathered with bravado. \"Do not believe in rumours. Do not spread rumours. If you feel unwell, go to the hospital in time,\" the message said. \"Wuhan is a city that dares to face difficulties and keeps overcoming them,\" the female voice added, mentioning the deadly 2002-03 SARS epidemic and 1998 Yangtze River flooding. But some foreigners in Wuhan expressed deep concern, saying they feared going outside even though their food supplies were running low. \"The bustling city looks like a ghost town from my window. The shops are all shut down,\" Bangladeshi doctoral candidate Israt Zahan told AFP by phone. \"I am rationing the food at my home.

Whether the outbreak will continue to spread at this rate depends on the effectiveness of control measures, the scientists who conducted the studies said. But to be able to contain the epidemic and turn the tide of infections, control measures would have to halt transmission in at least 60 per cent of cases. The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak jumped to 56 on Sunday (Jan 26), with close to 2,000 people infected worldwide - the vast majority in China. \"It is unclear at the current time whether this outbreak can be contained within China,\" said Neil Ferguson, an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College London who co-led one of the studies. Ferguson's team suggest as many as 4,000 people in Wuhan were already infected by Jan 18 and that on average each case was infecting two or three others. A second study by researchers at Britain's Lancaster University also calculated the contagion rate at 2.5 new people on average being infected by each person already infected. \"Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan, we predict (it) will be substantially larger by Feb. 4,\" the scientists wrote.

Australia, a popular destination for Chinese visitors, confirmed its first four cases of the virus in travellers from China, all of whom had been to Wuhan. \"What we need is more data to be published on risk factors, transmission, incubation period and epidemiology, so we can understand what control measures are most appropriate,\" MacIntyre said.

Here's what China has been doing as it struggles to contain the virus that has spread within the country and overseas. Thirteen cities have been quarantined in an attempt to contain the virus. Transport such as trains, buses and passenger boats were halted from leaving and entering Wuhan as the city was placed under effective lockdown. Those already on their way have been ordered to return to their starting points. Airlines, including Singapore Airlines\u2019 budget arm Scoot, have cancelled flights in and out of the city. Other cities in Hubei province \u2013 such as Zhijiang, Xiantao and Huanggang \u2013 have also experienced lockdowns and transport closures, affecting about 56 million people. The province has announced it will stop operating online taxis and impose passenger restrictions on the roads. The southern city of Shantou announced a partial lockdown on Jan 26, the first city to implement such a measure outside the epicentre for the disease. Authorities in Beijing, Xi\u2019an and Tianjin have also announced they are suspending long-distance and chartered buses that enter and leave their cities. The Chinese government has dispatched 450 military medics to Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus. This is in response to the rising number of cases in the city, where hospitals are overwhelmed and medical supplies are running low. Many of these medics are experienced in dealing with infectious diseases such as SARS and Ebola. People waiting at a hospital in Wuhan said they have been waiting hours, even days, to see the doctor. The city is building two makeshift hospitals to add hundreds of beds to meet demand. Work on the first facility began on Friday (Jan 24) and it could be ready in just over a week, say state media. It is being built around a holiday complex originally intended for local workers. Prefabricated buildings, which will have 1,000 beds, will be put up, said the Changjiang Daily. \"The construction of this project is to solve the shortage of existing medical resources,\" the report said. \"Because it will be prefabricated buildings, it will not only be built fast but it also won't cost much.\" Several tourist spots in the country have been shut down as a result of the outbreak. Shanghai Disneyland said on its website it would temporarily close from Saturday \"in response to the prevention and control of the disease outbreak and in order to ensure the health and safety\" of its guests and staff.

Many people on social media have been calling for the week-long holiday to be extended to help prevent further spread of the virus. WeChat, China's ubiquitous messaging app, warned that it could ban accounts spreading rumours. China has called for transparency in managing the crisis, after a cover-up of the spread of the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002\/2003 eroded public trust, but officials in Wuhan have been criticised for their handling of the current outbreak. \"People in my hometown all suspect the real infected patients number given by authorities,\" said Violet Li, who lives in the Wuhan district where the seafood market is located. \"I go out with a mask twice a day to walk the dog - that's the only outdoor activity,\" she told Reuters by text message. Many cinemas across China are also closed with major film premieres postponed, slashing revenues. Theatres in the country took in just 1.81 million yuan (US$262,167) from tickets on Saturday, a tiny fraction of the 1.46 billion yuan on Chinese New Year's Day in 2019, according to data from movie-ticketing company Maoyan. Cruise operators including Royal Caribbean Cruises, Costa Cruises, MSC Cruises and Astro Ocean Cruises said that they cancelled a combined 12 cruises that had been scheduled to embark from Chinese ports before Feb 2. On Saturday, Hong Kong declared a virus emergency, scrapped celebrations and restricted links to mainland China. Hong Kong Disneyland and the city's Ocean Park theme park were closed on Sunday. Shanghai Disneyland, which expected 100,000 visitors daily through the Chinese New Year holidays, has already closed. In Hong Kong, with five confirmed cases, the city's leader Carrie Lam said on Saturday that flights and high speed rail trips between the city and Wuhan will be halted. Schools in Hong Kong that are currently on Chinese New Year holidays will remain closed until Feb 17. On Saturday, Canada declared the first \"presumptive\" confirmed case of the virus in a resident who had returned from Wuhan. The patient, a male in his 50s, arrived in Toronto on Jan 22 and was hospitalised the next day after developing symptoms of respiratory illness, officials said. Australia confirmed its first four cases on Saturday, Malaysia confirmed four and France reported Europe's first cases on Friday. The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. There are fears transmission could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel during the holiday, although many have cancelled their plans and airlines and railways in China are providing full refunds for tickets. Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of such screenings. In an illustration of how such efforts could miss cases, doctors at a Paris hospital said two of the three Chinese nationals in France who have been diagnosed with the virus had arrived in the country without showing any symptoms. A report by infectious disease specialists at Imperial College, London on Saturday said the epidemic \"represents a clear and ongoing global health threat,\" adding: \"It is uncertain at the current time whether it is possible to contain the continuing epidemic within China.\" Full coverage: https:\/\/cna.asia\/wuhan-virus","summary":"BEIJING: China on Sunday (Jan 26) banned wildlife trade nationwide in markets, supermarkets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms due to the coronavirus outbreak, the country's market watchdog, agricultural ministry, and forestry bureau said in a joint statement.

National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei, speaking at a press briefing, said authorities' knowledge of the new virus was limited and they are unclear on the risks posed by mutations of the virus. Ma said the incubation period for the coronavirus can range from one to 14 days, and that the virus is infectious during incubation, which was not the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003. Containment efforts, which have thus far included transportation and travel curbs and the cancellation of big events, will be intensified, Ma told a crowded news briefing on the second day of the Chinese New Year holiday. The central Chinese city of Wuhan and more than a dozen other cities in Hubei province have been locked down in a rapidly expanding quarantine effort marked by transport shutdowns and other restrictions on movement. The virus, believed to have originated late last year in a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife, has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Australia, France, the US and Canada. On Sunday, China announced a nationwide ban on the sale of wildlife in markets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms. Chinese authorities have so far reported 1,975 cases nationwide.

Like SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which was traced to bats and civets, the virus that has killed dozens in China and infected almost 2,000 people is believed to have originated in animals trafficked for food. Final findings are yet to be announced, but Chinese health officials believe it came from wildlife sold illegally at a market in the central city of Wuhan that offered enough animals to fill a zoo, including civets, rats, snakes, giant salamanders and live wolf pups. The so-called \"bushmeat\" trade, plus broader human encroachment on wild habitats, is bringing us into ever-closer contact with animal viruses that can spread rapidly in our uber-connected world, said Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a global NGO focused on infectious disease prevention. The Global Virome Project, a worldwide effort to increase preparedness for pandemics, which Daszak is a part of, estimates there are 1.7 million undiscovered viruses in wildlife, nearly half of which could be harmful to humans. Daszak said the project's research indicates we can expect around five new animal-borne pathogens to infect humanity each year. \"The new normal is that pandemics are going to happen more frequently,\" he said. \"We are making contact with animals that carry these viruses more, and more, and more.\" Viruses are a natural part of the environment, and not all are the stuff of sci-fi horror. But the recent track record of animal-hosted viruses that \"jump\" to humans is sobering. Like SARS, which killed hundreds in China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003, Ebola also was traced to bats, while HIV has roots in African primates. Today, more than 60 per cent of new emerging human infectious diseases reach us via animals, scientists say. Even familiar menu items like poultry and cattle - whose pathogens we have largely adapted to over millennia - occasionally throw a curveball, like bird flu or mad-cow disease. \"For the sake of these wild species' future, and for human health, we need to reduce consumption of these wild animals,\" said Diana Bell, a wildlife disease and conservation biologist at University of East Anglia who has studied SARS, Ebola and other pathogens. \"But, 17 years on (from SARS), apparently that hasn't happened.\" Wild-meat consumption itself is not necessarily dangerous - most viruses die once their host is killed. But pathogens can jump to humans during the capture, transportation, or slaughter of animals, especially if sanitation is poor or protective equipment not used. With scrutiny rising amid the viral outbreak, China on Sunday ordered a temporary ban on wildlife trading until the viral epidemic eases. But conservationists say China has repeatedly failed to deliver on pledges to crack down. Chinese authorities have addressed the problem partly by encouraging a farmed-animal industry. This has included for endangered species like tigers, whose parts are prized in China and other Asian countries as aphrodisiacs or for other uses. But that comes with its own downside, by providing a channel for more sought-after wild-caught beasts to be laundered as \"farmed\", Bell said. She added that wildlife traders also had become more savvy, avoiding market scrutiny by selling directly to restaurants. Environmental groups say Chinese demand, fuelled by rising consumer buying power, is the biggest driver of the global bushmeat trade today. Some rare species have been prized in China as delicacies or for unproved health benefits since ancient times. Traditionally, a host gains \"face\" by serving guests or business partners expensive, hard-to-acquire wild fare. Yang Zhanqiu, a pathogen biologist at Wuhan University, said modern demand also is bolstered by widespread distrust of a Chinese food industry tarnished by years of repeated safety scandals. \"People will think: Wild is natural, natural is safe,\" Yang said. \"Everyone wants to eat better, so there is a market for wild animals.\" Daszak said \"it's very difficult to stop an activity with 5,000 years of cultural significance\". But recent surveys strongly indicate that China's younger generation - swayed partly by animal-rights campaigns involving popular Chinese celebrities - are much less inclined to tuck into bat, rat, or salamander, he added. \"I think that in 50 years this will be a thing of the past,\" Daszak said. \"The problem is that we live in such an interconnected world today that any pandemic like this can spread globally in three weeks.\"","summary":"SHANGHAI: The animal-borne SARS virus 17 years ago was supposed to be a wake-up call about consuming wildlife as food, but scientists say China's latest epidemic indicates that the practice remains widespread and a growing risk to human health.

But she said she didn't want to leave on the chartered flight if it meant carrying the virus back home. \"I'm not going to endanger anybody else. And that's just erring on the side of caution,\" she told the broadcaster. France is also planning to evacuate its citizens stuck in Hubei province by bus, and French carmaker PSA - which has a sizable presence in Wuhan - said it was formulating plans to evacuate staff and relatives for quarantine in a neighbouring province.

The city of 11 million is the epicentre of the new SARS-like epidemic and has been in quarantine since Thursday (Jan 23) - with nobody allowed to leave as the government tries to contain its spread. At one Wuhan hospital AFP visited, there were long queues of sick patients, many coughing, with overwhelmed staff unable to process them quickly. Outside the Red Cross facility - which is one of the hospitals people are sent to for initial tests if they show signs of infection - patients told AFP they felt exasperated and helpless. \"It has been two days since I slept, and I have been wandering from hospital to hospital,\" said a man in his 30s, who was trying to see a doctor because he was worried he might be infected. \"At this rate, my turn will be tomorrow morning at best.\" Nearly 2,000 people have been infected across the country and 56 have died - mostly in Hubei. Those who spoke to AFP told of extremely long queues and disorganisation. One spoke of a fear that sick patients with fevers will infect each other while waiting in long queues, even if they didn't have the coronavirus when they first arrived at the hospital. Another man said he had seen several people faint while waiting. Many people carried their own plastic stools to sit on, while one pragmatic man had brought a lounge chair with him. Volunteers were taking patients to the hospital on Sunday after cars were ordered off the road. Authorised neighbourhood committees were transporting patients instead. \"There are no cars, so we are responsible for taking them there,\" said one volunteer, 40-year-old Yin Yu. The health crisis struck just before Chinese New Year - the most important date of the Chinese calendar, when millions of workers travel across the country to visit family - putting more pressure on the understaffed hospital. \"It takes at least five hours to see a doctor,\" one woman, who didn't want to be named, told AFP. The woman, who was with her son, said the management of the hospital was \"really messy\". An old man wearing a Mao cap said he had waited all day to see a doctor, only to be sent home because of a \"lack of room\". AFP saw some patients inside the hospital who were without masks, despite city orders that anyone going out must wear them. Patients were taking their own temperatures with mercury thermometers, by mouth or armpit, and there were no checks on anyone entering or leaving the hospital. And there was no sign that the flow of patients would ease up. \"Do not spread rumours. If you feel unwell, go to the hospital in time,\" was the message played over loudspeakers in the city. Wuhan hospitals are \"saturated\", the Municipal Health Commission admitted to the People's Daily. Faced with a congested medical system, authorities are racing to build two hospitals of over a thousand beds each within two weeks, and deployed hundreds of medical reinforcements to Wuhan. Patients say more capacity is sorely needed. \"There is no more space, the staff are overwhelmed, there is a shortage of some medicine, and patients are being left to fend for themselves,\" said one 30-year-old. He showed AFP pictures on his smartphone of a patient lying on the floor attached to a respiratory device. AFP was unable to verify the authenticity of the photograph. The vast majority of cases have been reported in Hubei, and several Wuhan residents said they think the figure is far below the real number. One person said there were \"many deaths\" in the hospital, and he did not believe the bodies were properly removed. \"It was like a horror movie,\" he said.","summary":"WUHAN: Overwhelmed staff members, patients waiting for hours to see a doctor, people fending for themselves: Wuhan residents describe scenes of chaos from one swamped hospital struggling to cope with crowds who may be infected by the new coronavirus.

Defying the threat from a contagious respiratory illness that broke out in the city and has killed dozens of people, Zhang and other Wuhan residents are pitching in by driving sick fellow citizens to hospital. \"We're from Wuhan, and even though you guys are here to help us, our own citizens should also come out to (help),\" Zhang Lin told AFP journalists as he waited for a patient to emerge from a clinic for the drive back home. \"There has to be someone who does this.\" The 48-year-old Zhang and others have been enlisted by the government to provide the free service, and it is sorely needed. Wuhan has for days been the nucleus of a transport lockdown that began in the city of 11 million and has since been expanded to much of the rest of Hubei province, in an attempt to cut off transmission routes for the virus. Wuhan's public transport system has been halted, taxi services curtailed and, on Sunday, new restrictions were introduced banning most cars from the streets. Difficulty getting around adds another challenge for sick people who, even after they reach overwhelmed hospitals, may need to wait hours to see hard-pressed doctors. But drivers like Yin Yu have obtained special dispensation to drive for humanitarian reasons. \"There are no cars, so we are responsible for sending them there ... and taking them back. This is all for free,\" said Yin, 40. To many Chinese, such can-do attitudes are hardly surprising for Wuhan. The city, located in the centre of the country on the Yangtze River, was the starting point for an armed rebellion against the Qing dynasty in 1911 that ended imperial rule - and gave the city's people a reputation for toughness. That toughness was referenced in a public announcement blaring from a loudspeaker in the city on Sunday, which offered tips on hygiene and seeking medical care, but also a dose of civic pride. \"Wuhan is a city that dares to face difficulties and keeps overcoming them,\" said a female voice. \"This is not the first time we have faced a similar situation. In 1998 we fought against extreme (Yangtze River) flooding. In 2003 we fought SARS,\" it said, referring to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a national viral epidemic similar to the current one.","summary":"WUHAN, Hubei: Citizens of China's virus-stricken city of Wuhan have been told to stay indoors, avoid strangers and keep their cars off the road, but locals like Zhang Lin are refusing to sit by and watch their hometown suffer.

Hong Kong authorities had said they would convert \"Fai Ming Estate, an unoccupied public estate in Fanling, into temporary flats for quarantine and observation of close contact persons without symptoms if needed.\" Following the protest, the government said it would \"cease the related preparation work in Fai Ming Estate.\" Hong Kong has been convulsed with demonstrations over the last seven months centred on Hong Kong's relationship with mainland China: with some protesters railing against what they see as growing interference from Beijing. Hong Kong authorities have so far refused to categorically block the flow of visitors from mainland China across several land border crossings.","datetime":1580089440000,"date_time":1580123232000},{"title":"China orders public holiday extended to curb epidemic","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/asia\/china-orders-public-holiday-extended-to-curb-epidemic-12352528","article":"BEIJING: Chinese authorities have ordered the extension of a public holiday in an effort to contain an epidemic that has killed 80 people and infected more than 2,300 nationwide, state-run media reported.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited the central city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, as the government sought to signal it was responding seriously to the crisis. The total number of confirmed cases in China rose about 30 per cent to more than 2,700, about half of them in Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan. As worries grew around the world, Chinese territory Hong Kong, which has had eight confirmed cases, banned entry to people who had visited Hubei in the past 14 days. The ban does not cover Hong Kong residents. The number of deaths from the flu-like virus in Hubei climbed to 76 from 56, health officials said, with five deaths elsewhere in China, including the southern island province of Hainan, which reported its first fatality on Monday. While a small number of cases have been confirmed in more than 10 countries, linked to people who travelled from Wuhan, no deaths have been reported elsewhere. Premier Li is the most senior leader to visit Wuhan since the outbreak began. Clad in a blue protective suit and mask, he inspected efforts to contain the epidemic and spoke to patients and medical staff, the government said. The government is extending the week-long Chinese New Year holiday by three days to Feb 2, in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. The Chinese New Year is usually a time for millions of people to travel, but many have had to cancel their plans because of travel curbs over the virus. China has locked down Hubei in the country's centre, an unprecedented operation affecting tens of millions of people and intended to slow transmission of the respiratory virus. Its ability to spread appears to be \"getting stronger\" though it is \"not as powerful as SARS\", top Chinese health officials said at a press conference. The previously unknown virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pathogen, which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Outside the epicentre, Shandong province and four cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an and Tianjin - announced bans on long-distance buses entering or leaving, a move that will affect millions of people travelling over the Lunar New Year holiday. The populous southern province of Guangdong, Jiangxi in the centre, and three cities made it mandatory for residents to wear face masks in public. Originating in Hubei's capital of Wuhan, the virus has spread throughout China and across the world - with cases confirmed in around a dozen countries including as far away as the United States. The US State Department said on Sunday it was arranging a flight from Wuhan to San Francisco for consulate staff and other Americans in the city. France's government and the French carmaker PSA also said they planned to evacuate staff and families, who will be quarantined in a city in a neighbouring province. Japan is coordinating with Beijing to swiftly evacuate its citizens, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said. Saudi Arabia asked its nationals present around Wuhan to contact its embassy for evacuation, while Jordan said it had obtained permission from Beijing to move its citizens from the city out of the country. Instead of New Year revelry, Wuhan has been seized by an eerie calm that deepened on Sunday as new restrictions banned most road traffic in the metropolis of 11 million. Loudspeakers broke the silence by offering tips slathered with bravado. \"Do not believe in rumours. Do not spread rumours.

The health emergency has overwhelmed Wuhan's hospitals with patients, prompting authorities to send hundreds of medical reinforcements, including military doctors, and start construction on two field hospitals. The number of confirmed cases in the city could rise by 1,000, Wuhan's mayor Zhou Xianwang predicted on Sunday, based on the number currently undergoing observation in hospital. He also said around five million people had left the city during the new year travel rush. Speaking at a press conference and wearing a face mask, Zhou said the city's medical staff were \"very strained and tired\". With non-essential vehicles banned from the road, volunteers stepped up to drive sick fellow citizens to hospitals. \"There has to be someone who does this,\" Zhang Lin, 48, told AFP journalists as he waited for a patient to emerge from a clinic for the drive back home in nearly deserted streets. Some foreigners in Wuhan expressed deep concern, saying they feared going outside. \"We want to be evacuated as soon as possible, because either the virus, the hunger or the fear will kill us,\" Mashal Jamalzai, a political science student from Afghanistan at Central China Normal University, told AFP. The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that a Wuhan market where animals including rats, snakes and hedgehogs were reportedly sold is \"highly relevant\" to the outbreak, state news agency Xinhua reported on Monday. On Sunday, the government said it was banning all trade in wildlife until the emergency is over, but conservationists complain that Beijing has previously failed to deliver on such pledges. Animal rights groups called for the ban to be made permanent, saying it could end the possibility of future outbreaks. Health officials said the virus has since become transmissible between humans. At a press briefing in Beijing, CDC head Gao Fu said the disease \"is indeed ... not as powerful as SARS.\" However, it also appears that the \"spreading ability of the virus is getting stronger,\" said Ma Xiaowei, head of China's national health commission.

NORWICH: The SARS outbreak in 2002 to 2003 was the first global pandemic of the 21st century. There were over 8,400 reported cases and 11 per cent of those infected with the virus died. Its cause was a newly identified coronavirus (a type of virus that causes respiratory infections): SARS Co-V. Early cases were linked to wildlife markets and restaurants in Guangdong, China, where researchers found SARS-like coronaviruses in animals including masked palm civets and a racoon dog. A Chinese government team subsequently reported that 66 out of 508 wildlife handlers tested in other markets across Guangdong were positive for antibodies to the SARS virus. The Chinese authorities responded by imposing a temporary ban on the hunting, sale, transportation and export of all wild animals in southern China. They also quarantined or culled civets reared for human consumption in the many civet farms across the area. Civets testing positive for SARS may have secondary infections rather being than the source of the virus. They were probably infected during the \u201cspeed dating\u201d of zoonotic viruses circulating among the jumble of different animal species packed together at markets or while being transported to markets, often in China. At the Royal Society\u2019s international conference on Lessons from SARS in 2004 and in the related publication, we emphasised that wildlife trade was a threat to human health and a primary cause of biodiversity decline in China and South-East Asia. But here we are again, 17 years later, with another novel zoonotic coronavirus, this time in Wuhan, China. Once again, initial human cases were linked to a market selling a variety of live animals. A constantly changing range of species have been selected as the culprits in the past few days, including bats and snakes, (the latter results were quickly refuted), and even crickets and wolf cubs. But, as yet, there is no scientific evidence that the virus has been isolated from any of these, although a recent report stated that \u201c15 environmental specimens collected in the western section (of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market) were positive for 2019-nCoV virus through testing and genetic sequencing analysis\u201d. The report continues: \u201cDespite extensive searching, no animal from the market has thus far been identified as a possible source of infection.\u201d It is not evident what \u201cenvironmental specimens\u201d refers to here and a complete list of those animals present in, or available from, the market would be appropriate to release together with details of which and how many of these have so far been tested. Wild rodents, which are often present in these markets, should also have been collected and tested as SARS-like coronaviruses have also been isolated from wild rats in China. But we may be chasing our tails, as animals testing positive may not be the source of the current outbreak. We need to step back and learn the broader lessons here. The perfect conditions for the emergence of human pandemics from previously unknown zoonotic pathogens has been created as a result of three things. First, the shift from subsistence hunting of wildlife to its sale into an international trade network largely driven by demand in China. Second, the extensive cross-exposure within this wildlife trade of species and species populations, which would not mix or be in contact in the wild. And, third, the exploitation of new source populations as areas become depleted of target species. It is also important to emphasise that these wild animals are typically now more expensive to buy (sometime a status symbol) than domestic livestock, so the demand that perpetuates wildlife trade in the region is a dietary choice and not driven by low income. The solution is collective action to remove the demand and also the supply chains to these wildlife markets and \u201cfarms\u201d (often laundering animals from the wild rather than breeding them). The call to close wildlife markets across China \u2013 which started following the SARS outbreak \u2013 has also been echoed by experts in China and in external organisations worldwide, such as the Wildlife Conservation Society. We have to hope that the Wuhan outbreak is a wake-up call for regulation of wildlife trade and animal health, action that is urgently needed to protect human health and the environment.

As the death toll from the Chinese epidemic jumped to 80 with those affected worldwide approaching 3,000, analysts said there were growing fears the crisis could become as bad as the SARS outbreak that hammered Asian markets in 2003. The outbreak of the coronavirus has led China to lock down the epicentre of the disease Wuhan - a city of 11 million people - while imposing tight travel restrictions on a number of other cities including Beijing. The move comes during the Chinese New Year holiday when hundreds of millions of people criss-cross the country and spend billions of dollars. The government decided late Sunday it would extend the holiday and related school closures beyond the original Jan 30 end date to \"reduce population flows\", state media said. The outbreak has led to the cancellation of Chinese New Year festivities, along with temporary closures of Beijing's Forbidden City, Shanghai's Disneyland and a section of the Great Wall. Stephen Innes at AxiCorp warned the economic shock to China and the world - just as a growth slowdown appeared to be easing - could be massive. \"The biggest threat to the global economy is not just because the disease spreads quickly across countries through networks related to global travel,\" he said in a note. \"But also because any economic shock to China's colossal industrial and consumption engines will spread rapidly to other countries through the increased trade and financial linkages associated with globalisation.\" He added: \"Unlike 2003 where SARS was less impactful on the developed world market, the rest of the world could feel the pinch this time around.\" If the new virus has the same impact on China as SARS, the falls could be worse then projected, Innes said, because consumption is a bigger part of the country's economy and its overall growth trajectory is weaker. Most regional markets were closed for the Chinese New Year break but Tokyo was open and fell 1.9 per cent by the break. Wellington, Manila and Jakarta also dropped. Both main oil contracts tumbled more than 2 per cent, having dropped more than 6 per cent last week owing to concerns about the effects on demand in the world's number two economy. The flight to safety saw the yen rally against the dollar, with the unit now up more than 1 per cent from eight-month lows touched earlier this year. Gold, another go-to asset in times of turmoil and uncertainty, is heading back towards US$1,600 and the six-year peaks touched at the start of January. While the main focus is on the spread of the virus, traders will also be keeping an eye on the release of earnings this week from top companies including Apple, Facebook and Samsung.","summary":"HONG KONG: Fears over the global economic impact of the deadly China virus sent oil prices plunging more than 2 per cent on Monday (Jan 27) to extend last week's sell-off, while safe-haven assets including the yen and gold rallied.

The task force is co-chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong. Among other measures, Mr Wong announced at a media conference that people should defer all non-essential travel to mainland China, an extension from an earlier advisory to defer all travel to Hubei. \"We are doing this now because of the latest developments in China which the China government itself has described as grave and they have also said the virus is getting stronger and infections will continue to rise,\" said Mr Wong. Given Singapore's status as an international transport hub, Mr Wong said this extended travel advisory is a necessary safeguard against further spread of the virus. Authorities will also strengthen border measures by implementing temperature screening for all incoming flights by Wednesday, Mr Wong said. Thermal scanners will be deployed at the piers of the airport to cover all incoming flights, he added. Currently, temperature screening is only conducted for passengers on flights from China at air checkpoints. Temperature screening will continue at land checkpoints for bus, car and train arrivals and at sea checkpoints. There will also be additional attention given to flights from mainland China at the aerobridge. These include visual identification of unwell travellers for evaluation by the medical team. Travellers deemed unwell with fever or respiratory symptoms, or have relevant travel history to Hubei, will be referred to nursing stations. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will also check passengers who are in possession of passports issued in Hubei. Such passengers will be referred for attention to ensure that they are well, and to obtain their contact details to expedite subsequent contact tracing if required. There will also be \"extra precautions\" taken for the workforce and students returning from mainland China, Mr Wong said. For students returning from China from Tuesday, they will be given a Leave of Absence (LOA) for 14 days so they can stay at home and minimise close contact with others. The minister said organisations have been advised to collect health and travel declarations from employees returning from mainland China from Tuesday. \"We are doing this now, we are getting ready now because we fully expect more to come back after the Chinese New Year holidays,\" he added. More stringent precautions are in place for organsiations with staff who have close contact and sustained interactions with vulnerable populations. These measures will apply to schools, including preschools, healthcare and eldercare facilities. Employers in these sectors will need to issue a Leave of Absence for 14 days upon their workers' return to Singapore. The general workforce is recommended to follow these measures as well. Employers may adopt additional precautionary measures if they choose to do so. Mr Wong said: \"We have no evidence that there is community spread of the virus in Singapore. But it may happen. And if it does we stand ready to take additional measures.\" \"I want to assure Singaporeans that we will do everything we can to protect Singaporeans and Singapore, but this does not mean overreacting or worse turning xenophobic. We must be proactive and rational in our response and base our actions on the available evidence and data,\" the minister added. The most important defence is still at the individual level. To beat the virus, it would not be enough for the Government to act alone, he said. Singapore has so far confirmed four cases of the SARS-like virus - the fourth was announced early Sunday morning. The first case of the novel coronavirus in Singapore was announced on Thursday, while two cases were confirmed on Friday. Contact tracing has been activated for confirmed cases and as a precautionary step, Government quarantine facilities have been set up to house close contacts who are well. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said there were no new confirmed cases of the Wuhan virus in Singapore as of noon on Sunday, adding that it has been notified of 92 suspected cases in total. Of the 92 suspected cases, 46 have tested negative for the new coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China. Test results for the remaining 42 cases are pending.

This applies to all students and staff of government schools, including MOE kindergartens, primary, secondary, special education schools, junior colleges and the Millenia Institute, who return from mainland China on Jan 15 or later. For polytechnics and Institutes of Technical Education (ITEs), which reopen a day earlier on Tuesday, the leave of absence for students and staff applies if they return from China on Jan 14 or later. The leave of absence will last for 14 days, starting from the day after their arrival in Singapore. This duration mirrors the incubation period of the coronavirus. Students on leave of absence will be supported through a home-based learning plan, MOE said. Schools will also start daily temperature taking exercises when they reopen after the Chinese New Year holidays on Wednesday. Students and staff will be monitored for any signs of flu-like symptoms. More than 800 students and several staff members who travelled to mainland China will have to take a leave of absence, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung at a press conference on Monday. Two individuals from government schools - one student and one staff member - visited Hubei province in the past 14 days, while 712 students and 62 staff members visited mainland China in the same period. From polytechnics and ITEs, three individuals visited Hubei province, while 107 students and six staff members visited mainland China. \"We do expect the numbers to go up as travel declarations come in,\" Mr Ong said, although he highlighted that the numbers were \"fairly manageable\" considering the number of schools in Singapore. Pre-school students and staff members returning from mainland China to Singapore from Jan 14 will have to take a two-week leave of absence as well. All pre-schools were notified in an advisory from the Early Childhood Development Agency on Monday morning, said Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee. Mr Lee also said that pre-school operators should provide paid leave of absence to affected employees, and monitor their health. About 500 to 600 pre-school teachers had gone to or returned from China for various reasons such as study trips and vacations, he said. Out of the 180,000 pre-school children in Singapore, he estimated that about 1,000 would have gone to or returned from China. \"We believe it's manageable. We are closely working with some 400 pre-school operators to make sure that this is smoothly managed,\" he said. \"ECDA as well as MSF (Ministry of Social and Family Development) colleagues will be visiting various pre-schools to check on implementation and provide support to the sector.\" Singapore's six autonomous universities have agreed to implement the same measures, said Mr Ong. \"Of course, there are also other private institutions,\" he said. \"For international schools, we will be contacting them and advising them to follow the same protocol.\" Mr Ong said schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have also ensured that there will be no organised trips to China until the end of March. \"Students who are already in China, the IHLs are in the process of recalling them.\" The new coronavirus, which originated in China\u2019s Wuhan, has so far killed 80 people and infected more than 2,700. A handful of cases have been reported outside China, including four in Singapore. MOE had earlier instituted a range of measures to protect schools against the virus, including requiring students and staff to declare their travel history and advising those who travelled to China to take their temperature regularly upon their return. \u201cThe latest LOA (leave of absence) measure allows MOE to better mitigate the potential risks posed by travel in our schools and institutions, while enabling them to continue with the usual learning and other activities,\u201d the ministry said. The ministry also advised students and their families to monitor their health and adopt good personal hygiene habits. \u201cParents should seek immediate medical attention for their children if unwell, and ensure that their children recover fully before they return to school for classes,\u201d it said. Mr Ong said the leave of absence advisory is different from a quarantine order as individuals are not legally required to comply. \"Having said that, (the government schools and IHLs) are all part of MOE,\" he said. \"So as an organisation, we will be able to enforce it.

The State Council, China's cabinet, said Li would meet with patients and medical staff on the frontline. The premier was appointed head of a working group to tackle the epidemic, which began at a market in Wuhan that was selling wild animals for food. The group has already announced an extension to the Lunar New Year holiday originally scheduled to end on Jan 30 \"to reduce population flows\". Transport curbs have also been imposed around China to cut off transmission routes. Wuhan is already under virtual lockdown and severe limits on movement are in place in several other Chinese cities. The central city of 11 million people clamped down further on Monday, announcing the immediate suspension of visa and passport services for Chinese citizens until Jan 30.

Speaking at a multi-minister task force news conference on Monday (Jan 27), Mr Iswaran made this point by citing a case involving a post on HardwareZone Forum which was viewed by 4,600 unique visitors before it was eventually taken down. The post falsely claimed that someone in Singapore had died from the virus. The office overseeing the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) issued a general correction notice to SPH Magazines over the post. SPH Magazines, which operates HardwareZone Forum, complied with the correction notice in a post on Monday which included a link to the Factually article. SPH Magazines also said that HardwareZone.com had taken down the thread earlier, \"in line with its community guidelines\". For the facts of the case, the POFMA Office referred to a Factually article which said there have been no deaths among the confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus infection as of 11pm on Jan 26. Mr Iswaran said: \"Some who viewed the post would also have shared it with others and been misled by it. The Minister for Health had ascertained that there was a false statement of fact and was satisfied that it was in the public interest to issue a correction direction.\" \"We must take swift action against such falsehoods. Otherwise, there is a grave risk that they will spread and cause panic among our citizens.

He added that if any other cases come to the Government\u2019s attention, the same kind of evaluation would be applied and appropriate action taken. Mr Iswaran said the aim is to keep Singaporeans informed of the facts so that they can safely navigate the online terrain, discern truth from falsehood and know what they can do to lessen the risk to themselves and their family. He said his ministry is working closely with the Ministry of Health to regularly share important public information with citizens through multiple channels on social media and websites. \"The situation is fluid and we need the help and cooperation of the media, all Singaporeans and the residents in this critical national effort to prevent misinformation and falsehoods about the Wuhan coronavirus from sowing fear and causing panic in our society,\" he said.

At least 81 people have died since the new strain of coronavirus emerged in China's Wuhan, and millions are now under an effective quarantine, with all flights in and out of the city grounded and a ban on Chinese tour groups domestically and abroad. The measures come amid a boom in Chinese foreign travel, with the number of tourists from the country increasing nearly tenfold since 2003, according to a report by research firm Capital Economics. But businesses in destinations that rely on the huge numbers of Chinese tourists are already feeling the heat, with complaints of \"deserted\" beaches and shops, and concerns about the future. The outbreak carries echoes of the SARS crisis, which paralysed regional travel and battered local economies from late 2002. Chinese tourist numbers then fell by around a third. \"If they fell by a similar amount again, it would knock around 1.5-2.0 percentage points from (gross domestic product) in the most vulnerable countries,\" Capital Economics said. In Japan, the fall in Chinese visitors was already being felt in Asakusa, a popular tourist destination near the Sensoji temple. \"We've definitely been seeing less people this year,\" said Yoshie Yoneyama, 31, manager of a shop selling traditional Japanese sweets and a rice-based drink called amazake. \"I think there are less than half the numbers of last year or the year before,\" she told AFP. The number of Chinese holidaying in Japan has exploded from around 450,000 in 2003 to 8.4 million in 2018, accounting for 27 per cent of all inbound tourists as Tokyo works to expand the sector. But it will now be \"very difficult\" for Japan to achieve its target of 40 million tourists in 2020, Yuki Takashima, an economist at Nomura Securities, told AFP. And the effects will be felt beyond hotels, restaurants and tourist sites, because many Chinese tourists visit Japan specifically to shop. Electronic appliances and beauty products usually top of their lists, Takashima said, so retail outlets will see their bottom lines affected. The crisis has already sent Japan's key Nikkei index plunging, with stock in Shiseido - a cosmetics brand popular with Chinese tourists - plunging more than five percent on Monday. \"We can expect those stocks to continue to fall like dominoes,\" said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp. But he said Japan would be better placed to weather the storm than another top destination for Chinese tourists: Thailand. Tourism accounts for 18 per cent of the nation's GDP, with Chinese holidaymakers making up more than a quarter of total arrivals. The country's tourism minister has already warned a crisis on the scale of SARS could cost an estimated US$1.6 billion, and the effects are already clear in Phuket. \"For two days, the streets, the shops and the beaches have been deserted,\" said Claude de Crissey, who owns a 40-room hotel and a restaurant on the island. \"Phuket has focused almost exclusively on Chinese tourism ... if the situation continues, we will all be impacted,\" he told AFP. Australia too, already reeling from the effects of the bushfire crisis, is likely to feel the impact. Chinese visitor numbers doubled in the six years to June 2019, with mainlanders now accounting for 15 per cent of Australia's inbound tourists. Mario Hardy, CEO of the Pacific Asia Travel Association said it was hard to gauge how long the crisis would last. \"I would suspect the impact would be between three to six months, but it will really depend on how the situation evolves in the coming few weeks,\" he told AFP. In Japan, leather goods store owner Hayato Chiba said local businesses in the Ameyoko shopping district of Tokyo's Ueno were hoping for a swift resolution. \"An increasing number of shops in Ameyoko count on foreign customers, so it's getting a bit tough,\" said Chiba, 65, who represents around 400 local businesses. \"Something really serious is happening.

Alibaba said the measure applied across all its divisions, including to workers in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau as well as in mainland China. It employs more than 100,000 people worldwide, most of whom are in China. The Shanghai government also imposed a similar measure, announcing that all companies in the city would not be allowed to start work before Feb 9, as did the nearby city of Suzhou, home to a big industrial park for pharmaceutical firms and tech companies. The decision by the Shanghai government will affect companies such as Tesla Inc, General Motors and Volkswagen which either own factories or operate them in the city through ventures with local partners.

But Mr Wong, who co-chairs a multi-ministry task force spearheading Singapore's response to the outbreak, said it was too early to tell at this stage how the Wuhan virus compares to SARS. \"The medical experts tell us as of now that the virus is not as infectious as SARS, (the) fatality rate is lower as of now,\" he said. \"But the situation is evolving so quickly, and as you all heard from the Chinese authorities yesterday, the virus is getting stronger, the number of infections is likely to rise. \"So we just have to be psychologically prepared that this can get worse than SARS.\" Back in 2003, the SARS coronavirus infected 238 people in Singapore and killed 33, including doctors and healthcare workers. The virus spread through close contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.

Mr Wong stressed that Singapore is better prepared to deal with an outbreak after learning lessons from the SARS episode. \"We have put in place inter-ministry coordination mechanisms.

Mr Mak also said Singapore is collaborating with different healthcare stakeholders on improving its testing capabilities for the virus. \"(We are) seeing how we can use these capabilities to enhance our hospital and health services\u2019 ability to detect, screen and confirm the presence of such infections,\" he said.

As for the Wuhan coronavirus, Mr Wong said: \"Some of you asked: What if there is a risk of infections spreading even before symptoms show. \"If that were to happen, I think the spread of the virus will be much faster because we are unable to identify and isolate unlike SARS - we had the means to because of symptoms.\" Nevertheless, Mr Wong said there is no conclusive evidence yet to prove that the Wuhan virus is capable of spreading pre-symptoms. \"It's certainly something we are watching out for, because if indeed this is happening, then certainly, we will have to do more and escalate our measures even further.\" Mr Wong said there are many \"imponderables\" and \"uncertainties\" regarding the Wuhan virus, adding that Singapore has to be prepared that things could worsen with more cases in China and abroad. Minister Wong said the Government is prepared to \"marshal all available resources\" to fight the virus' spread.","datetime":1580150040000,"date_time":1580152274000},{"title":"Capgemini passes first hurdle in Altran bid despite Elliott resistance","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/business\/capgemini-passes-first-hurdle-in-altran-bid-despite-elliott-resistance-12358390","article":"French consulting and IT services provider Capgemini  succeeded in securing more than half of the capital of smaller rival Altran Technologies, the French market regulator AMF said on Monday, marking a win against U.S. activist fund Elliott.

The AMF said Capgemini holds 53.6per cent of Altran's share capital and at least 53.4per cent of the voting rights. The group - which faced a tussle with Altran shareholder Elliott over its offer price - had aimed to get the backing from just over half of Altran's investors to pursue its bid. Earlier in January Capgemini had slightly raised the price of its friendly bid for Altran to 14.5 euros a share from 14 euros, valuing the company at 3.7 billion euros (US$4.1 billion). That move failed to convince Elliott, which has built up a stake of over 15per cent in Altran, to tender its shares to the group's offer, which closed on Jan. 22. The AMF said Capgemini's offer would be reopened to other investors, though it did not give a fresh timeframe. Capgemini is hoping the deal will add to its services in industries from telecoms to aerospace and help it slash costs. Altran shares were up 1.4per cent after the results of Capgemini's offer were announced, a rare bright spot in a European stockmarket spooked by coronavirus fears.

The outline of a floor began to take shape and electrical switchboards were already up on Monday (Jan 27) when AFP reporters visited the site of the facility, dubbed \"Fire God Mountain\", being built in Wuhan, the central city where the coronavirus first emerged. It is one of two makeshift hospitals that Chinese authorities are rushing to build within a fortnight in the city of 11 million people to relieve medical facilities swamped with patients waiting for hours to see doctors. Work to build Fire God Mountain started Friday and is due to be ready to receive patients on Feb 3, according to state media. The second one, named \"Thunder God Mountain\", will be ready for use on Feb 5. The construction workers all wore masks as mandated by the authorities for the entire population of the city, which has been under lockdown since Thursday. They are checked for fevers when they arrived by bus and again during their breaks. They worked around a forest of excavators and trucks bringing in prefab material at the site on the southwestern side of the city. \"We have to work fast to combat the epidemic,\" a worker in his 30s, who refused to give his name, told AFP. He said he worked nine hours per day, \"sometimes less, sometimes more. It depends on what they need\". The 25,000-square-metre hospital will have between 700 and 1,000 beds to treat patients of a pneumonia-like virus that has killed 81 people - mostly in Wuhan - and infected more than 2,700 across the country. The second facility will have 1,300 beds. \"We've mobilised all the workers left in Wuhan to work in shifts to ensure round-the-clock construction,\" Zhang Chongxi, general manager of the road and bridge company of Wuhan Construction, was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency. Chen Bingzhong, a former health ministry official, said the facilities are needed because infectious diseases should not be treated in general hospitals. \"Because the infectious power of this virus is too strong, it will infect other patients, including medical staff,\" Chen told AFP. China has experience building hospitals in record time in periods of crisis. In 2003, it built a facility in Beijing within a week to treat patients during the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic. Authorities have used this as a model for the new facilities for the patients ill with the novel virus, which shares genetic similarities with SARS. Premier Li Keqiang visited one of the construction sites on Monday during his first trip to Wuhan since the health crisis erupted - a sign of the growing concern among the leadership in Beijing. \"Fast doesn't mean without quality,\" Li, who wore a mask, told the workers, according to videos of his visit. \"Fire God Mountain\" is being erected next to a residential building. A road outside the construction site is used to park dozens of trucks and construction vehicles. The city's new rallying cry - \"Let's go Wuhan!\" - was written on a banner across the front of a truck. Bulldozers flattened the earth, electricians installed 5G antennas and workers began to bury pipes. \"We are happy to help in this situation.

Lately, he has had trouble finding basic supplies such as milk and eggs in the city of 11 million since it became the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak that has killed 81 and infected 2,740 people in China. \"There's a shortage. Everyone wants to stock up, but it is already too late,\" Badeephak told Reuters via Skype. \"There are no vehicles on the road except private vehicles, which I only see going to pharmacies and hospitals,\" he added. Badeephak wants to go home to Thailand, he has little choice but to wait. The Thai government has put a military plane on standby for a possible evacuation of its citizens, but Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Monday (Jan 27) they do not yet have Beijing's permission for the airlift. Most commercial flights out of Wuhan were halted last week to try to contain the virus. \"At the moment the Chinese authorities have said the situation is still under control, so we have prepared a plan ...

The UN health body said in a situation report published late Sunday that the risk was \"very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level.\" In a footnote, the WHO said there had been an \"error\" in previous communications published on Thursday, Friday and Saturday which \"incorrectly\" said the global risk was \"moderate\". Asked for more detail, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said only that it was \"an error in the wording\". The WHO on Thursday stopped short of declaring the virus an international public health emergency - a rare designation used only for the most severe outbreaks that could trigger more concerted international action. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is visiting China this week to discuss further action to contain the virus, on Thursday said: \"This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency\". WHO's cautious approach can be seen in the context of past criticism over its slow or too hasty use of the term, first used for the deadly 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. During that outbreak, the UN health agency was criticised for sparking panic-buying of vaccines with its announcement that year that the outbreak had reached pandemic proportions, and then anger when it turned out the virus was not nearly as dangerous as first thought. But then in 2014, the WHO met harsh criticism for dragging its feet and downplaying the severity of the Ebola epidemic that ravaged three west Africa countries, claiming more than 11,300 lives by the time it ended in 2016.

The woman was \u201casymptomatic\u201d during her flight to Singapore, MOH said, adding that she later developed symptoms on Jan 24 and was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on Jan 26. She was then classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated at NCID. \u201cSubsequent test results confirmed Wuhan coronavirus infection on Jan 27,\" said MOH. The ministry added that she has no known links to the other confirmed imported cases. Before she was admitted to the hospital, the 56-year-old stayed with her family at their home at Ceylon Road, said MOH. She stayed at home after the onset of symptoms, until she was taken to hospital two days later. MOH said as of Monday at noon, 62 of the suspect cases tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus, and four tested positive. The fifth case involving the 56-year-old female was confirmed at 2pm. Test results for the remaining 57 cases are pending, the health authority said. MOH also identified 115 close contacts from the first four confirmed cases as of Monday at noon. Of the 86 who are still in Singapore, 75 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. The authority added efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 11 close contacts. \u201cContact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts,\u201d MOH explained. \u201cAs a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. \u201cIn addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.\u201d The deadly virus has killed 82 people in China so far, with more than 2,700 confirmed cases. Earlier on Monday, a recently formed multi-ministry task force announced Singapore will have a new set of stringent measures in an effort to contain the deadly coronavirus that originated from Wuhan. These measures include enhanced temperature screening and compulsory leave of absence for students and teachers returning from China. Singapore's first confirmed case was a 66-year-old Wuhan man who stayed at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa. This was followed by the confirmed cases of the man's 37-year-old son and a 53-year-old woman from Wuhan.

At least 106 people have died from the virus in China, and more than 4,000 people have been infected across the nation. Cases have been identified in more than a dozen other countries, including the first confirmed patients in Canada and Sri Lanka. The United States urged its citizens to \"reconsider\" all travel to China and told them not to go to central Hubei province, where the pneumonia-like virus emerged. Mongolia closed its vast border to vehicles from China. In a sign of the mounting official concern, Premier Li Keqiang visited ground zero to oversee containment efforts in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people where the disease first appeared late last month. The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, effectively trapping tens of millions of people, including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to contain the virus as the Chinese New Year holiday unfolds. China decided to extend the holiday, initially due to end on Jan 30, for three days to limit population flows and control the epidemic. US President Donald Trump said the United States has offered China \"any help that is necessary\" in combating the virus. The health commission in the capital said a 50 year-old-man who visited Wuhan died of respiratory failure on Monday, less than three weeks after visiting the city. More than 700 new infections were confirmed in the country, while the number of suspected cases doubled over a 24-hour period to nearly 6,000. The youngest infected patient was a nine-month-old baby being treated in Beijing. In Wuhan, AFP reporters saw construction workers labouring on one of two field hospitals that China is racing to complete by next week to relieve overcrowded facilities swamped with people waiting for medical attention. On day five under quarantine, residents shouted \"Go Wuhan\" from their windows, according to videos posted online, and a building lit up the night sky with the words in red. \"I'm getting more concerned every day,\" Do Quang Duy, a 32-year-old Vietnamese masters student in Wuhan, told AFP. Landlocked Mongolia - which is heavily dependent on trade with China - closed the border with its huge neighbour to cars, cancelled classes until Mar 2 and suspended large public gatherings. Malaysia banned visitors from Hubei province. Turkey and Germany advised their citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China altogether. A US-bound flight is scheduled to leave Wuhan on Tuesday with consular staff and some American citizens. France plans to fly citizens out of the city in the middle of this week. Japan will also bring its citizens home. Belgium, Bangladesh, India and Spain said they were working to repatriate their nationals, while Germany was considering the possibility. The World Health Organization last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted international trade or travel restrictions. But the world body said on Monday that the global risk from the deadly virus in China was \"high\", admitting an error in its previous reports that said it was \"moderate\". WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus headed to Beijing for discussions with Chinese officials. Global stock markets and oil prices plunged on Monday over coronavirus fears. The virus is believed to have jumped to people from animals in a Wuhan market that sold a wide range of exotic wild game. China on Sunday banned all wildlife trade until the emergency subsides. The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003 and was also traced to the wild game trade. Authorities around China have already imposed aggressive curbs on transport during the usually high-traffic Chinese New Year season to keep the virus from spreading. At Beijing's main international airport, almost all passengers wear masks. Fever checks are conducted at subway and railway stations. Typically, hundreds of millions of people criss-cross China in jam-packed buses and trains during the holiday, a time for family reunions. But the festivities have been ruined this year by the coronavirus, which can be transmitted between humans, with people told to avoid gatherings. Countless popular public attractions and seasonal festivals have been shut down. Several Beijing malls shortened their opening hours, according to state media. The nationwide measures threaten to put a dent in an economy that was already slowing down. Beijing and Shanghai were among places mandating stringent checks and 14-day observation periods for people arriving from Hubei. Wuhan's mayor Zhou Xianwang said around 5 million people had left the stricken city during the new year travel rush in January, highlighting fears the virus could spread further.

Health authorities in the capital, Beijing, reported the first coronavirus death on Monday of a 50-year-old person who had been to Wuhan, state media said. It was not immediately clear if the death was included in the total. All the deaths were in China. Li, clad in a blue protective suit and mask, thanked medical workers in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and the epicentre of the outbreak. \"Li ... thanked frontline medical workers for their all-out efforts in treating patients and urged them to pay attention to their own protection,\" Xinhua news agency said. \"He required efforts to guarantee medical resources supply, race against time to treat patients and ensure adequate market supply and stable prices.\" He said 2,500 more medical workers would arrive in the next two days. Li is the most senior leader to visit Wuhan since the outbreak began. He inspected efforts to contain the epidemic and was shown on state television leading medical workers in chants of \"Wuhan jiayou!\" - an exhortation to keep their strength up. He also visited the construction site of a new hospital due to be built in days. On China's heavily censored social media, where dissent is typically suppressed, local officials have borne the brunt of mounting public anger about the handling of the virus. Some lashed out at the Hubei governor, who had to correct himself twice during a news conference over the number of face masks being produced in the province. \"If he can mess up the data multiple times, no wonder the disease has spread so severely,\" one Weibo user said. Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster CCTV the city's management of the crisis was \"not good enough\" - rare public self-criticism for a Chinese official - and said he was willing to resign. The city of 11 million people is in virtual lockdown and much of Hubei, home to nearly 60 million people, is under some kind of travel curb. People from Hubei have come under scrutiny within mainland China as well, with many facing suspicion from officials about their recent travels. \"Hubei people are getting discriminated against,\" a Wuhan resident complained on the Weibo social media platform. A small number of cases linked to people who travelled from Wuhan have been confirmed in more than 10 countries, including Thailand, France, Japan and the United States. Investors are worried about the impact on travel, tourism and broader economic activity. The consensus is that in the short term, economic output will be hit as Chinese authorities impose travel restrictions and extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, when millions traditionally travel by rail, road and plane, by three days to limit the spread of the virus. Asian and European shares tumbled, with Japan's Nikkei average sliding 2 per cent, its biggest one-day fall in five months. Demand spiked for safe-haven assets such as the Japanese yen and Treasury notes. European stocks fell more than 2 per cent. During the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally, air passenger demand in Asia plunged 45 per cent. The travel industry is more reliant on Chinese travellers now than it was then. The total number of confirmed cases in China rose to 2,835, with about half in the central province of Hubei. But some experts suspect the number of infected people is much higher. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has had eight confirmed cases, banned entry to people who had visited Hubei in the past 14 days. The number of deaths from the virus in Hubei climbed to 76 from 56, officials said, with five deaths elsewhere in China. The newly identified coronavirus is believed to have originated late last year in a Wuhan market illegally selling wildlife. Much is not known, including how easily it spreads and just how deadly it is.

Analysts said there were growing fears the crisis could become as bad as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that hammered markets and the global economy in 2003. \"Coronavirus fears have gripped the markets ... as all the major European equity benchmarks are nursing big losses,\" said analyst David Madden at trading firm CMC Markets UK. \"Stocks that are connected to China are feeling the pain ... as traders are afraid the health crisis will curtail economic activity.\" The outbreak has led China to lock down the epicentre of the disease, Wuhan - a city of 11 million people - while imposing tight travel restrictions on a number of other cities including Beijing. The move comes during the Lunar New Year holiday when hundreds of millions of people criss-cross the country and spend huge amounts of money. Most Asian markets were closed for the Lunar New Year break but Tokyo was open and fell two percent. Bangkok plunged nearly three percent on worries about the Thai travel sector. The flight to safety saw the yen rally against the dollar, with the Japanese unit now up more than one percent from eight-month lows touched earlier this year. The dollar however rose against the euro and pound. Gold, another go-to asset in times of turmoil and uncertainty, seemed headed back towards US$1,600 per ounce and the six-year peaks touched at the start of January. While the main focus is on the spread of the virus, traders will also be keeping an eye on the release of earnings this week from top companies including Apple, Facebook and Samsung. The oil market had already tumbled more than six percent last week owing to concerns about the virus' effect on demand in China, which is the world's number two economy after the United States.

The US Commerce Department report on Monday (Jan 27) also showed downward revisions to sales for the prior three months, bucking a recent streak of fairly strong housing data. Strength in housing, following a slump in 2018 through the first half of 2019, could offset some of the drag on economic growth from weakness in business spending and manufacturing. New home sales slipped 0.4 per cent last month to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 694,000 units, with sales in the South dropping to the lowest in more than a year. It was the third straight monthly decline in sales. November's sales pace was revised down to 697,000 units from the previously reported 719,000. September and October sales were also marked down. \"Low mortgage rates, a robust labour market and stabilising geopolitical tensions suggest that demand for housing will stick around, and buyers are hungry for more housing options,\" said Matthew Speakman, economist at online real estate firm Zillow. Sales last month were concentrated in the US$200,000-US$749,000 price range. New homes priced below US$200,000, the most sought after, accounted for only 10 per cent of sales. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11.1 per cent of housing market sales, would increase 1.5 per cent to a pace of 730,000 units in December. The PHLX housing index fell, tracking a broadly weaker US stock market as investors worried about the economic fallout of the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak in China that has prompted the country to extend the Lunar New Year holidays and businesses to close some operations. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. US Treasury prices rallied. New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. Sales jumped 23.0 per cent from a year ago. For all of 2019, new home sales increased 10.3 per cent to 681,000 units, the highest since 2007. Cheaper mortgage rates have supported the housing market since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times last year. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 3.60 per cent from its peak of 4.94 per cent in November 2018, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. Officials from the US central bank are scheduled to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. They are expected to reiterate the Fed's desire to keep rates unchanged at least through this year, which could limit further declines in mortgage rates. Still, economists are optimistic the housing market will remain solid. \"Household formation trends are running ahead of new housing construction and this will buoy the housing market in 2020,\" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. Reports this month showed sales of previously owned homes jumped to near a two-year high in December and housing starts raced to a 13-year peak. Though permits for future construction of single-family housing permits fell in December, that followed seven straight monthly gains. Housing is expected to have contributed to GDP growth again in the fourth quarter. Residential investment rebounded in the third quarter after contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP to rise at a 1.8 per cent annualised rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1 per cent rate in the July-September period. The government will publish its snapshot of fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday. \"We still think that real residential investment posted a decent gain in the fourth quarter,\" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. The housing sector, which accounts for about 3.1 per cent of gross domestic product, remains constrained by a lack of homes, especially in the lower-priced segment of the market, because of land and labor shortages. That is keeping prices elevated. The median new house price rose 0.5 per cent to US$331,400 in December from a year ago. New home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, dropped 15.4 per cent in December to a rate of 347,000 units, the lowest since October 2018. Sales declined 11.8 per cent in the Northeast, but rose 10.1 per cent in the Midwest and surged 31.0 per cent in the West. There were 327,000 new homes on the market last month, up 1.6 per cent from November. At December's sales pace it would take 5.7 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.5 months in November. About two-thirds of new homes sold in December were either under construction or yet to be built.","summary":"WASHINGTON: Sales of new US single-family homes fell unexpectedly in December, likely held down by a shortage of more affordable homes, but lower mortgage rates supported the overall housing market.

Nancy Messonnier, head of respiratory diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said she was planning imminent changes on measures to control and track the deadly virus, beyond the current restrictions just on travellers arriving from Wuhan, which is at the epicentre of the outbreak. \"Right now, and based on CDC's analysis of the available data, it doesn't look like the [virus] has mutated,\" she said in a telephone news conference. \"All the sequences we've extracted are similar to the one that China initially posted a couple of weeks ago,\" she said. All passengers arriving from Wuhan are currently subject to testing in five US airports, but since China has suspended all flights out of the stricken city, there are fewer and fewer travellers from there arriving in the US. The virus has also reached other Chinese provinces and China has announced that people who are infected can spread the disease before they show any symptoms of fever or respiratory difficulties. That has rendered redundant the current measures to contain the virus in the US. \"I expect that in the coming days, our travel recommendations will change,\" said Messonnier. \"I expect there will be a decision, and an announcement about that within the next day.\" Despite that, the CDC still estimates the risk from the virus to Americans to be low. \"At this time in the US, this virus is not spreading in the community,\" Messonnier said. There have been five confirmed cases in the country and 110 patients have either been under observation or are currently being tested in 26 states. Aside from the five who so far tested positive, 32 have tested negative. It takes around a day to receive the test results from suspected cases because blood samples have to be sent to the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. The outbreak that began in Wuhan at the end of last year has killed at least 80 people and infected more than 2,700 in China. US President Donald Trump on Monday offered any help China needed to control the outbreak which has also left tens of millions stranded during the Chinese New Year, China's biggest holiday.

NEW YORK: The latest rally in U.S. stocks is facing a serious test, as the S&P 500 heads toward its worst loss in months on concerns over how the coronavirus will impact the global economy. So far, the selling has been measured, with most investors confident that the U.S. economy remains in good shape and the Federal Reserve stands ready to provide stimulus if the economic situation deteriorates. Still, worries have grown that months of placid trading may have left stocks primed for an upsurge of volatility. \"Markets hate uncertainty, and the coronavirus is the ultimate uncertainty,\" said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research, FTSE Russell, New York. \"With the markets overbought to begin with, this is now a sell first, ask questions later situation.\" The benchmark S&P 500  stock index has notched 71 days without a 1per cent move, the third such longest stretch since 1995. Past runs of quiet trading have tended to culminate in periods of turbulence: for instance, an unusually calm period from September 2017 to January 2018 preceded a sharp sell-off in U.S. stocks in February 2018, fueled by an implosion of bets that volatility would stay low. For an interactive graphic on S&P 500 moves, click here: http:\/\/fingfx.thomsonreuters.com\/gfx\/rngs\/GLOBAL-MARKETS-DASHBOARD\/010050DG0V9\/index.html On Monday, the Cboe Volatility Index  touched a three-month high and ended the session 3.67 points higher at 18.23 after having traded near its lowest levels over the past year earlier this month. The S&P 500 was on track for its biggest one-day percentage drop since October on Monday on news that the death toll from the virus grew in China and more cases were reported across the world. \"Positioning in the equity markets ... had gotten a little bit out of hand. That creates a lot of kindling for a fire in risk asset prices,\" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. There have been few tests to the bull market's most recent leg higher, which before Monday's losses has seen the S&P hit numerous fresh highs after the United States announced a trade deal with China in mid-December. Fears of a heightened conflict between the United States and Iran proved short-lived earlier this month, as did worries over delays in the signing of a trade agreement between Washington and Beijing in December. Growing confidence in the rally's durability had pushed investors to increase their exposure to equities: Allocations to global stocks stood at their highest level in 17 months, while cash levels have shrunk to a seven-year low, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers showed last week. Until last week, options also reflected muted concerns about a sharp pullback. Persistent low volatility would usually prompt greater demand for puts, which offer downside protection, in comparison to calls, used to participate in further upside, said Stacey Gilbert, portfolio manager for derivatives at Glenmede Investment Management in Philadelphia. But skew, a measure of interest in puts versus calls, for the S&P 500 rose only modestly in relation to the plunge in volatility. Investors could take comfort from the market's reaction to the 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak, when the S&P rallied more than 10per cent from the start of the outbreak to the announcement of its containment. Graphic: SARS timeline Image https:\/\/graphics.reuters.com\/USA-STOCKS\/0100B59736G\/sars-timeline.png A few investors have gone against the grain in recent weeks to purchase insurance against a jump in volatility while prices for most such bets have been relatively discounted. At least one investor earlier this month bought 225,000 calls that would require the VIX to hit 22 by late February in order to be redeemed. The index traded as high as 19.02 on Monday. \"People are nervous because the market has been going up for such a long time and done so well recently,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. \"I think this coronavirus may be more of an excuse than a rational estimate of its effects.\"","summary":"The latest rally in U.S. stocks is facing a serious test, as the S&P 500 heads toward its worst loss in months on concerns over how the coronavirus will impact the global economy.

Yang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease. Yang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. She has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time. \"My brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don't get any new answers,\" Zhang told Reuters. \"Every time the responses are the same: 'There's no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what's going on.' The doctors are all very frustrated too.\" Officially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan 10, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travellers from China for the virus within three days. However, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan's hospitals until about Jan 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters. Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities. During that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China. Despite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being \"rumour spreaders.\" \"The doctor didn\u2019t wear a mask, we didn\u2019t know how to protect ourselves ... no one told us anything,\" a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan 20, five days after she was hospitalised. \"I posted my aunt\u2019s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.\" National, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some \"loopholes\" in initial treatment methods. Wuhan's mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told Chinese state television on Monday he recognised that \"all parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information\". But he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders. \"In local governance, after I receive information, I can only release it when I'm authorised,\" he said. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested. China last week locked down the affected region in Hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. President Xi Jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak. The country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. However, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned. Once a virus has been identified, \"You need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you\u2019ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,\" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness. Although information from the region is scarce, Adalja suggested China has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. \"We\u2019re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,\" he said. John Edmunds, a professor at the centre for mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said China has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak. \"We have a very incomplete picture of what\u2019s going on,\" he told Reuters. \"Whether it\u2019s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, I don\u2019t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.\" The shortage of testing supplies and China's initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people. \"The improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus's genome, building new hospitals at a moment's notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,\" said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan's Center for Chinese Studies. City managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. The week in which no new virus cases were reported in Hubei coincided with preparations for Chinese New Year and sessions of the province's National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Seven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said. But four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials. To qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is \"impossible to conduct the test right away,\" an official at the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters. Three hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll. Wuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters. \"Some severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn't be able to be treated,\" the worker told Reuters. \"The actual deaths were higher.\" Reuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker's account. Hubei and Wuhan health authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Zhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three Wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus. However, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test. None of those hospitals replied to Reuters requests for comment. Sixty-nine-year-old Xu Enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since Jan 8, was rejected by six hospitals in Wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told Reuters. Xu's symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties. He was finally admitted on Jan 22 to queue for the test at Hankou hospital in Wuhan after his daughter publicised his case on Weibo. Researchers at Lancaster University estimate that only 5.1 per cent of infections in Wuhan have been identified. By Jan 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. More than 30,000 people in Wuhan are under observation, according to the city's health authorities. \"All we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,\" said a 33-year-old Wuhan woman surnamed Liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since Jan 14 and was still untested on Monday. \"At least if it's confirmed we have a direction. If there's no direction, there's no hope.\"","summary":"BEIJING: Yang Zhongyi was still waiting on Monday (Jan 27) for a coronavirus test in the Chinese city of Wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son Zhang Changchun told Reuters. Yang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease. \"Every time the responses are the same: 'There's no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what's going on.' The doctors are all very frustrated too.\" Officially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan 10, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. However, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan's hospitals until about Jan 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters. During that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China. They told me to take it down.\" National, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested. \"The improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus's genome, building new hospitals at a moment's notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,\" said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan's Center for Chinese Studies. Seven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said. But four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials. Three hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll. Wuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters.

As the death toll reached 81 and the virus spread to more than 10 countries, including France, Japan and the United States, some health experts questioned whether China can contain the epidemic. Beijing has already extended the Lunar New Year holiday to Feb. 2 nationally, and to Feb. 9 for Shanghai. On Tuesday, the country's largest steelmaking city in northern Hebei province, Tangshan, suspended all public transit in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.

Stocks on Wall Street fell more than 1per cent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500  held near three-week lows after slumping 1.6per cent overnight for their biggest single day percentage loss since last October. Analysts at JPMorgan said the coronavirus outbreak was an \"unexpected risk factor\" for markets though they see the contagion as a regional rather than a global shock. \"The rise in risk aversion and worry of a region-wide demand shock ... means the knee-jerk market reaction will likely be to richen low-yielding government bonds,\" JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note. \"Concerns about coronavirus contagion has driven yields lower and is the latest risk of a series that have driven US Treasuries (UST) yields far below what fundamentals indicate.

Yields on two-year paper  also fell sharply while Fed fund futures  rallied as investors priced in more risk of a rate cut later this year. Futures imply around 35 basis points of easing by year end . The Federal Reserve is widely expected to stand pat at its policy meeting this week, but markets will be sensitive to any changes to its economic outlook. JPMorgan said they have not yet altered their developed or emerging markets forex forecasts though they were taking profits on their \"bullish\" EUR\/USD positions and remain \"considerably long\" on Swiss francs which benefits from safe-haven demand. Short build-up in the Aussie was another risk hedge. In the currency market, the dollar index  added 0.1per cent to 97.948 led by safe-haven demand. The euro  was steady at US$1.1019.

LONDON: The world should be more anxious than it was a week ago. According to research published on Friday (Jan 24), a new SARS-like coronavirus has been present in China since Dec 1, a full month before the alarm was raised. Almost 3,000 people have been diagnosed with the respiratory illness. As of Monday afternoon, at least 35 cases were outside China. Eighty-two people have already died. Despite draconian quarantining, the virus, provisionally known as 2019-nCoV, is spreading. Several countries, including the UK, are considering evacuating nationals from the hot zone. It is now time for the World Health Organisation to call a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The revised timeline on when the virus began circulating comes courtesy of two papers in The Lancet medical journal, which reveal other worrying details. One sets out the clinical data on the first 41 laboratory-confirmed patients. Patient zero, who fell ill on Dec 1, had no link to the seafood market in Wuhan that is widely assumed to be the source of the outbreak. A further 13 of those 41 cases showed no link either. It is possible that the virus began circulating earlier than December. Other analyses separately suggest that containment is now a forlorn hope. The \u201creproduction number\u201d is thought to lie between two and four \u2014 meaning that, on average, each infected person passes the virus to between two and four others. That is high: Seasonal flu has a reproduction rate of about 1.4. The incubation period could be about a week, with infected individuals possibly being contagious while showing mild or no symptoms. Neil Ferguson, an Imperial College epidemiologist, estimated that 4,000 were infected by Jan 18. Jonathan Read, of Lancaster University, and colleagues provisionally calculate that the tally could exceed 190,000 by Feb 4. A \u201cgrave situation\u201d for China, as President Xi Jinping describes the epidemic, is a grave situation for the world. A fifth of the global population is now potentially exposed to a highly transmissible, currently incurable and potentially fatal respiratory virus. Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet, believes a PHEIC declaration should be considered. \u201cThe emergency committee [of the WHO] should reconvene as a matter of urgency,\u201d Mr Horton said, adding that he felt there were political sensitivities at play that have not dogged other epidemics, such as Ebola in west Africa. Recent developments, such as a special committee set up by China\u2019s ruling party, have also heightened rather than allayed his concerns. He says: \u201cNot one [of the people on that committee] has any background in public health. That makes me very worried.\u201d Mr Horton also fears the mass social unrest that may accompany prolonged quarantine with patchy information. It is unclear whether the WHO knew in advance of China\u2019s quarantine plans. The language emerging from its meetings has been painfully diplomatic, with its director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus remarking only that he hoped the extreme measures were \u201cboth effective and short in their duration\u201d. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said it was \u201cright and appropriate\u201d for China to control the first response. Antivirals were going into randomised trials on the ground, he said, and vaccines might become available within six months. He acknowledged, though, that the social consequences of quarantining millions of people remained \u201cuncharted territory\u201d. All factors considered, it is perverse to see the coronavirus outbreak as anything other than a PHEIC.

The virus, which can cause a pneumonia-like acute respiratory infection, has in a matter of weeks killed more than 100 people and infected at least 4,000 in China, while cases have been identified in more than a dozen other countries. In a fresh report on the new virus, known as 2019nCoV, the UN health agency said current estimates put the incubation period for the virus at between two and 10 days. \"Understanding the time when infected patients may transmit the virus to others is critical for control efforts,\" WHO said. It did not immediately confirm assertions made by Chinese authorities that people who are infected can spread the disease before they show any symptoms of fever or respiratory difficulties. \"Detailed epidemiological information from more people infected is needed to determine the infectious period of 2019nCoV, in particular whether transmission can occur from asymptomatic individuals or during the incubation period,\" it said. WHO last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern - a rare designation used only for the worst outbreaks that would trigger more concerted global action. But the world body admitted Monday it had made an error in its risk assessment for the deadly virus in several reports last week, acknowledging the global risk was \"high\" rather than \"moderate\". The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003 and was also traced to the wild game trade. The new virus is believed to have jumped to people from animals in a Wuhan market, but it has since begun spreading between humans, although the exact mode of transmission has yet to be confirmed. As with SARS and another deadly coronavirus known as Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, WHO suggested that the new virus could be spreading through droplets, for instance when people sneeze or cough, or through direct contact with infected people or with objects they have touched. To reduce the risk of infection, WHO stressed the need to avoid close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections, frequently wash one's hands, and avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. The agency also stressed the importance of practising so-called cough etiquette, including maintaining distance and covering coughs and sneezes with tissues. WHO has not recommended any international travel or trade restrictions, but does call for high levels of vigilance, including encouraging airport exit and entry screening for passengers leaving affected areas to check for fever and coughs.","summary":"GENEVA: The World Health Organization said Monday (Jan 27) it remained unclear if the deadly coronavirus spreading in China and beyond is contagious during its incubation period, before symptoms appear.

The deadly virus, which experts believe emanated from a wild animal market in the city of Wuhan last month, has triggered a desperate Chinese containment effort after spreading nationwide and to more than a dozen other countries. The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in central Hubei province, effectively trapping more than 50 million people, including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to contain the virus as the high-travel Chinese New Year holiday unfolds. As those trapped in Wuhan have become increasingly anxious, governments have scrambled to devise ways to safely get their citizens out of the city of 11 million. The United States, France and Japan are among those to have announced plans for airlifts, but nearly a week after the lockdown the evacuations have yet to happen. A chartered US-bound flight had been scheduled to leave Wuhan on Tuesday with consular staff and some American citizens. But the State Department said that had been postponed to Wednesday, without giving a reason. France has also said it intends to fly its citizens out of the city in the middle of this week, and Japan has similar plans. Several other countries also were working to repatriate their people, while Germany said it was considering doing so. Singapore authorities said they are working with China to bring home citizens stuck in Wuhan. On Monday, Singapore's Senior Minister of State for Transport Janil Puthucheary said officials are in touch with Singaporeans currently in the city and are exploring options for repatriation, including with airline companies. The virus can be transmitted between people, although scientists have yet to determine how contagious it is and exactly the way it is spread. In bids to stop huge numbers of people coming into close contact with each other, China has imposed tight transport restrictions in other parts of the country. It has extended the Chinese New Year national holiday into next week. The education ministry on Tuesday also said the spring semester for schools and universities nationwide would be postponed, without giving a resumption date. Despite the unprecedented measures, the virus has showed little sign of slowing down. The national health commission on Tuesday said 26 new deaths occurred in the preceding 24 hours, bringing the nationwide total to 106. Confirmed infections in China also jumped to 4,515, it said, up from 2,744 on Monday. There were nearly 7,000 more cases suspected and awaiting confirmation, according to the commission. The virus has also continued to spread around the world. On Monday, the first infections were confirmed in Germany, Canada and Sri Lanka. Fears over containment were heightened on Sunday when Wuhan's mayor, wearing a medical mask, revealed at a press conference that five million people had left the city for other parts of the country during the massive travel rush that precedes the New Year holiday. President Donald Trump said the United States has offered Beijing \"any help that is necessary\" in combatting the virus. But the United States, Turkey and Germany were among nations urging their citizens to \"reconsider\" all travel to China. Malaysia on Monday banned visitors arriving from Hubei. Landlocked Mongolia - which is heavily dependent on trade with China - took the drastic step of closing the border with its huge neighbour to cars. Mongolia also cancelled classes until Mar 2 and suspended large public gatherings. Medical facilities have been overwhelmed in Wuhan, which has become a near ghost-town. China has deployed hundreds of military medics to ease the pressure, and started building two hospitals with the aim of finishing them in just 10 days. AFP reporters saw hundreds of mask-wearing workers toiling around the clock to assemble one of the pre-fab field hospitals. Construction began just days ago but the outline of a floor was already taking shape and electrical switchboards were up on Monday. \"We have to work fast to combat the epidemic,\" a worker in his 30s, who refused to give his name, told AFP. Stressed Wuhan residents living under the quarantine expressed fears for the health and dwindling supplies at home. \"I'm getting more concerned every day,\" Do Quang Duy, a 32-year-old Vietnamese masters student in Wuhan, told AFP. But Wuhan's people, who have a reputation in China for resilience, sought to project a fighting spirit. Quarantined residents shouted \"Go Wuhan\" from their windows, according to videos posted online. A building lit up the night sky late on Monday with those words in red. The World Health Organization (WHO) last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted a more aggressive international response such as travel restrictions. But the WHO on Monday admitted making an error in originally assessing the virus' worldwide threat as \"moderate\", issuing an update late on Sunday to say the risk was actually \"high at the global level.\" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus travelled to Beijing this week for discussions with Chinese officials to coordinate on the crisis.","summary":"WUHAN, Hubei: The United States and other nations raced to get their citizens out of the locked-down Chinese city at ground-zero of a virus epidemic on Tuesday (Jan 28), as the death toll surged to 106 and the number of confirmed infections doubled to over 4,500. The deadly virus, which experts believe emanated from a wild animal market in the city of Wuhan last month, has triggered a desperate Chinese containment effort after spreading nationwide and to more than a dozen other countries. The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in central Hubei province, effectively trapping more than 50 million people, including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to contain the virus as the high-travel Chinese New Year holiday unfolds. France has also said it intends to fly its citizens out of the city in the middle of this week, and Japan has similar plans. Singapore authorities said they are working with China to bring home citizens stuck in Wuhan. On Monday, Singapore's Senior Minister of State for Transport Janil Puthucheary said officials are in touch with Singaporeans currently in the city and are exploring options for repatriation, including with airline companies. In bids to stop huge numbers of people coming into close contact with each other, China has imposed tight transport restrictions in other parts of the country. The national health commission on Tuesday said 26 new deaths occurred in the preceding 24 hours, bringing the nationwide total to 106. Confirmed infections in China also jumped to 4,515, it said, up from 2,744 on Monday.

Speaking to reporters after a visit to a My First Skool centre in Buangkok where he observed the implementation of additional steps which the pre-school had put in place, Mr Lee stressed the importance of such initiatives as well as the measures which the Government has already taken to help students and teachers. Among the steps implemented by the My First Skool centre is having temperatures taken for parents as they drop off their children. \"These are measures which are needed to ensure the well-being of our children and pre-school staff,\" he said. \"Yesterday we also announced (the implementation of) a leave of absence for children in pre-schools as well as pre-school staff who have visited China in the last 14 days and moving forward.\" He added: \"This is again a stepped-up precautionary measure because in pre-schools and these other social facilities we have more vulnerable communities like young children, elderly, persons with disabilities and so on. \"For parents, please be assured that we have robust measures in place; we are working closely with our pre-school operators.\" As of Jan 27, five cases of the Wuhan virus have been confirmed in Singapore. The deadly virus has killed at least 106 people in China so far, with more than 4,000 confirmed cases. My First Skool, which has more than 140 centres islandwide, has rolled out measures such as increased cleaning of facilities, as well as increased frequency of temperature taking to safeguard students and staff, said general manager Ms Thian Ai Ling. \"On a daily basis, we've always paid close attention to personal hygiene,\" said Ms Thian. \"Given the current situation, what we have stepped up is an additional layer of temperature taking as well as (during) multiple periods throughout the day, we are closely watching our children's well-being, ensuring that they do not show any symptoms. \"Should they do, we will contact parents immediately.\" When reporters visited a My First Skool centre at Buangkok on Tuesday, staff wearing surgical masks were observed taking the temperatures of parents and children upon their arrival outside the centre. The hands of parents and children were also sanitised before they entered the premises. In addition, staff members also made sure to check on the travel history of students and their parents, in the event that they did not complete a travel declaration which was sent last week. As a whole, further steps could be required down the road should the situation change, Mr Lee added. \u201cThe situation is fluid and evolving, the Government will look at the available information and evidence, look at the international guidelines and we may need to take further steps as the situation evolves,\u201d he said. For now, parents reporters spoke to said they were generally satisfied with the precautions taken at the centre at Buangkok. \"Even on normal days where there's a typical outbreak like hand,foot and mouth (disease), they would already have taken extra measures for that to ensure that the kids are safe,\" said Mr Lee Tai Yun, who was dropping off his 3-year-old daughter. \"So I'm pretty sure that this is just another day in their lives to try and control (the situation).\" However, there are also concerns that others might not have not been upfront about their travel history. \"Not only parents but relatives as well, as we do not know whether the (other) children might have relatives who came back from China.\" said Mdm Janani Rajendran. \"I was considering keeping my child at home because we don't know what are the odds.\" Another parent, Mr Zulfadli Abdullah, said that he had no qualms sending his son to the centre after the Chinese New Year holidays. \"Right now we have these measures in place, and if something were to happen, I would expect more measures.

He is part of a group of researchers that manages an online dashboard about the outbreak. Epidemiologists have no crystal ball. They have only piecemeal information on the new virus, which appeared in December. They use mathematical models to estimate the actual number of cases, as of the current date, and compare them to past outbreaks - but many of their hypotheses remain uncertain. Until the past weekend, researchers thought that infected people were not contagious until they began exhibiting symptoms, such as fever, respiratory problems, and pneumonia. But Chinese authorities said Sunday they had established the opposite. US health authorities said Monday they had not seen evidence that asymptomatic patients can infect other people. But if they can, this would definitely change the outbreak's dynamics. The first estimates for the length of the incubation period - about two weeks - are recent. In recent days, multiple experts have calculated an important parameter for any outbreak: The basic reproduction number, or \"R0\". It represents the number of people contaminated by an infected person. Estimates range from 1.4 to 3.8, according to Fisman, figures that are considered moderate. That is only an average: some patients may infect many people, while others infect only a few. \"On its own, it isn't a reason to panic,\" said Maimuna Majumder, a researcher at Harvard University and at Boston Children's Hospital. She said the rate is 1.3 for seasonal flu (which has millions of cases per year) and between two and five for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which resulted in 8,000 cases and 774 deaths, the majority in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. In comparison, the rate for measles ranges from 12 to 18. Quarantines and isolation measures, systematic hand washing and masks could help drive down the average number of infected people. If the rate falls below one, the epidemic will die down. But the effect of the control measures China has implemented won't be felt for another week or two, researchers say, based on the virus's cycle. \"The more we learn about it, the more it looks like SARS,\" said Fisman. \"SARS was controllable; hopefully this will be too. But we won't know for a few weeks.\" \"It's going to be many weeks, probably months, and nobody knows where this will go,\" he added. The official number of cases is more than 4,000 in China, with more than 100 deaths, and some 50 confirmed infections outside the country. But the actual number of Chinese cases, including those not yet detected, is likely to be more than 25,000, said Vespignani, according to the analysis of the group coordinated by Northeastern. And researchers at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) estimate that the number of actual cases has currently passed 40,000. \"It's easy to get to twice or three times as much, even just in the city of Wuhan,\" the virus's epicenter, said Vespignani. \"If we start to have other larger areas affected, then those numbers are going to be much, much bigger.\" He said he doesn't want to estimate the number of possible deaths. The mortality rate, until now, has hovered around three percent, but such rates have a tendency to fluctuate: they increase at the beginning as the most vulnerable patients die, then drop, and then rise again as others die. Again, only time will tell.","summary":"WASHINGTON: The deadly new coronavirus that has broken out in China, 2019-nCoV, will afflict a minimum of tens of thousands of people and will last at least several months, researchers estimate based on the first available data. \"It's not something that's going to end the next week or the next month,\" said Alessandro Vespignani, a professor at Northeastern University.

So far, all confirmed cases in Singapore are Chinese nationals from Hubei, similar to trends elsewhere, added MOH. The fact that 95 per cent of confirmed cases in Chinese cities were recently in Hubei also confirms that the infection has spread most widely in the province. While there is currently no evidence of community spread in Singapore, but this presents a \"heightened risk\" to Singapore, the ministry said.

After the United States and Canada warned against travel to China where the new coronavirus is thought to have originated, Australian stocks resumed trading sharply lower after a public holiday the previous day. The benchmark S&P\/ASX 200 index  fell 1.4per cent weighed by stocks exposed to the illness that has killed more than 100 people and infected more than 2,700. Shares of airlines and travel agents were sharply lower amid freezes on travel into and out of the world's second largest economy, while companies with an indirect exposure to Chinese consumer spending abroad, such as casinos and luxury retailers, also tumbled. \"We don't know how long it will go,\" said Peter Costello, chairman of Australia's US$115 billion sovereign wealth fund, the Future Fund, in a media briefing to coincide with a regular portfolio update. \"Obviously we hope that the measures that have been taken now will contain the virus but it's still far too early.

But with uncertainties still swirling over the severity and spread of the virus, it is too early to tell how big a hit the new infectious coronavirus could have on the overall Singapore economy this year, they told CNA. As of Tuesday (Jan 28), Singapore has confirmed seven cases of the China-originated virus. Speaking at a multi-agency press conference on Monday, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing warned that the outbreak will affect Singapore\u2019s economy, business and consumer confidence in 2020, with tourism-related sectors being of \u201cimmediate concern\u201d. CIMB Private Banking economist Song Seng Wun said this impact on tourism will likely start showing as soon as next month, particularly after authorities in China announced a halt of all group tours, both at home and to other countries, with effect from Monday. China is the biggest source of tourists to Singapore, accounting for nearly one fifth of total visitor arrivals, he said. Already, one travel agency has seen a flurry of cancellations by Chinese tour groups over the past few days. Dynasty Travel\u2019s director of public relations and communications Alicia Seah told CNA that its bookings from China for February have \u201call been cancelled\u201d. Mr Song said: \u201cThe latest measure will see visitor arrivals for February being affected and other frontline sectors, like retail and F&B (food and beverage), will also take some impact.\u201d \u201cThe longer this ban stays in place, the bigger the impact,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd if the developments over the next month prove to be not as favourable, then it won\u2019t just be the Chinese that are travelling less but across all nationalities. That will further impact the tourism-related sectors here.\u201d Ms Selena Ling, OCBC\u2019s head of treasury research and strategy, also told CNA that the tour cancellations, alongside some hit to business and economic confidence, in the wake of the Wuhan virus outbreak will likely \u201ccast a shadow\u201d over Singapore\u2019s economic growth momentum in the first quarter of 2020. In a bid to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, China has also rolled out other measures, such as extending the Chinese New Year holiday. The effect of this extended break on factory output, alongside lower consumer spending as people stay at home, will have a \u201csignificant hit\u201d on the Chinese economy for the first quarter, said economist Rajiv Biswas from IHS Markit. This weaker Chinese demand for imports of goods and services could have \u201cflow-on effects\u201d to Singapore\u2019s manufacturing sector, which exports raw materials, intermediate and finished goods to China, the chief economist for Asia-Pacific added. But beyond that, these three economists stressed that it is still too early to assess the full impact of the virus on the Singapore economy. Ms Ling said: \u201cThe key questions are how long this will last, whether it will get more severe from here and what control measures are taken that might disrupt productivity. \u201cWhile people seem to be looking to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as a proxy, it is still too early to tell the full impact for now.\u201d Echoing that, Mr Biswas said the extent of the negative hit on Singapore\u2019s economic growth remains \u201chighly uncertain, depending on the speed with which the Wuhan virus epidemic is contained\u201d. Mr Song also noted that at the moment, consumer confidence in Singapore appears to be unaffected. \u201cThe thing to note is whether people are reassured by the immediate remedial measures that have been implemented. Compared with the SARS period where we were dealing with a virus outbreak for the first time, we\u2019ve since had Zika and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) and I think we are far better prepared in our preventive measures,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople seem to have gone on with their daily activities for now, though more are wearing masks. As long as people carry on with their daily lives, the impact on domestic activities won\u2019t be as severe.\u201d Nevertheless, economists noted that the outbreak coincides with a dip in overall exports and growth in Singapore\u2019s economy, suggesting less wiggle room should a worst case scenario happens. As such, Ms Ling said she is mulling a slash in the lower-end of her full-year growth estimate. \u201cWe were looking at 1 to 2 per cent for Singapore\u2019s economy in 2020, but we may adjust to 0 to 2 per cent to accommodate the potential downside risks,\u201d she said. Mr Chan on Monday had said that the Government will implement necessary measures to help businesses impacted by the Wuhan virus, as with previous episodes such as the SARS outbreak in 2003. These could include reducing business costs, alleviating cash flow problems and help to retain workers. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Government rolled out a S$230 million relief package to support the most adversely hit sectors. For the tourism-related industries, these included property tax rebates, reduction in foreign worker levy for unskilled workers, a bridging loan programme for small- and medium-sized enterprises to alleviate short-term cash-flow problems and enhanced training grants. The transport sector saw targeted measures such as diesel tax rebates for taxis and waivers of taxi operator license fees. Economists said it remains too early to speculate if the Government will release a relief package of a similar quantum this time round. They also had mixed views if help could come as early as the upcoming Budget in February. For instance, Mr Biswas thinks the upcoming Budget statement, which will be delivered on Feb 18 by Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, could include measures to assist the vulnerable tourism and travel sectors. On the other hand, Ms Ling reckoned that it is still early days into the virus outbreak and the Government could take a \u201cwait and watch\" approach. As of Tuesday, the death toll in China has jumped to 106 and the number of total confirmed cases up to 4,515, the country\u2019s authorities said. Across the world, confirmed cases have also been reported in Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam and the United States, heightening fears of the global economic impact of the new deadly virus. For Asia Pacific, the Wuhan coronavirus poses a \u201csignificant downside risk\u201d to region\u2019s economic outlook in the near term, if the epidemic continues to escalate in coming weeks, said Mr Biswas. \u201cThe extent and duration of this negative shock to regional economic growth will depend on how quickly the Wuhan virus epidemic can be brought under control, which remains very uncertain.\u201d Governments in Asia Pacific are likely to respond with a range of fiscal and monetary policy stimulus measures to prop up growth momentum in the near term. In particular, measures to help the tourism and travel sectors which are particularly vulnerable to this economic shock, he added.","summary":"SINGAPORE: The Wuhan virus outbreak is set to impact Singapore\u2019s tourism-related sectors in the coming months and possibly \u201ccast a shadow\u201d on economic growth for the first quarter, some economists said.

He apologised to the students affected and said that \"this is part of the national response\". \"We hope it won't happen, but should there be more contact tracing and confirmed cases, then we will need the facilities. So, it is better now before it happens that we get the facilities ready,\" he added.

SAN FRANCISCO: When Apple Inc posts quarterly results on Tuesday, investors will be looking for fresh evidence the iPhone maker should be treated as a producer of high-margin, subscription services after its stock market value touched US$1.4 trillion and its earnings multiple trades at decade highs. The Cupertino, California corporation's stock has doubled over the past year, even as iPhone sales contract along with the rest of the global smartphone market. Fueling its stellar run has been Chief Executive Tim Cook's push to turn Apple's loyal client base into a source of steady services revenue, including streaming video and a credit card launched last year with Goldman Sachs. Also supporting Apple's stock is excitement around an eventual pickup in iPhone demand with the rollout of 5G wireless technology, and low interest rates that have broadly helped Wall Street. Shares of Apple fell 2.9per cent on Monday from record highs as fears about the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak in China hit Wall Street. Analysts on Apple's quarterly earnings call after the bell on Tuesday will listen for comments concerning the impact on its manufacturing operations in China.Apple's market capitalization briefly exceeded US$1.4 trillion last Wednesday for the first time, but it has yet to end a session at that level. Some investors worry that Apple's rally, and surging earnings multiple, may have become overextended. \"The run-up in the stock is a concern, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see a bit of a pullback in the near future,\" said People's United Advisors chief equity strategist John Conlon, who added that Apple's services business has become his main reason for owning stock. Following its recent rally, Apple's stock is trading at the equivalent of 23 times expected earnings, its highest multiple since 2010, according to Refinitiv. Apple's average PE over the past decade was about 14, lagging other high-growth companies with recurring revenue and reflecting its singular dependence on iPhones sales and reliance on persuading consumers to upgrade their phones year after year. Salesforce.com and Netflix, which rely on recurring revenue, are trading at over 55 times expected earnings. Tech hardware sellers Intel and Cisco Systems are at about 14 times expected earnings. Apple is on track to reach a goal to double its 2016 services revenue to US$48.7 billion by the end of fiscal 2020 as it focuses on selling high-margin subscriptions to its user base. Many investors envision an increasingly rosy future for its earnings, a trend reflected in its soaring earnings multiple. Adding to existing services including cloud storage, the App Store and music, Apple last year launched an ambitious video streaming service, along with its credit card, a subscription news app and a videogame service. Apple has also increased the emphasis on its AppleCare, its extended warranty program. For example, the iPhone's \"settings\" now includes reminders encouraging people to buy or renew their AppleCare plans. In the September quarter, Apple said its services revenue hit US$12.51 billion, topping analysts expectations of US$12.15 billion. Services accounted for 20per cent of total revenue in that quarter, up from 17per cent in the same quarter the year before. Apple also gave cost of sales data showing gross margins for its services segment rose to 64per cent from a 61per cent a year earlier. That is far more generous than Apple's overall gross margin of around 38per cent in recent years. Still, for a business segment getting the most attention from Wall Street, Apple provides limited details. Apple's quarterly reports break out sales of iPhones, Macs and iPads, but a breakdown of results from products falling within the services category so far has not been released. Apple's recent strong stock performance has been perpetuated by fund managers buying its shares in order to avoid underperforming their benchmarks, a trend that could reverse when the recent rally ends, Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote in a client note last week. For the fiscal first quarter, which ended in December, analysts on average expect services revenue to jump 19.7per cent to US$13.0 billion, according to Refinitiv. Overall quarterly revenue is expected to rise 5.0per cent to US$88.5 billion, with adjusted net income inching up 1.5per cent to US$20.3 billion and earnings per share of US$4.55.","summary":"When Apple Inc posts quarterly results on Tuesday, investors will be looking for fresh evidence the iPhone maker should be treated as a producer of high-margin, subscription services after its stock market value touched US$1.4 trillion and its earnings multiple trades at decade highs.

LIVERPOOL: The World Health Organization\u2019s decision to not declare the novel coronavirus outbreak in China a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, will surprise many. The number of reported cases and deaths is doubling every couple of days, and patients have now been reported from many Asian countries, as well as the Middle East, Europe, Australia and the US. You might wonder how bad things have to get before this is deemed to be a global public health emergency. But such declarations by the WHO are not taken lightly, as Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) explained in the press conference. The concept of the WHO declaring global public health emergencies first arose after the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak. As with the current outbreak, it started in a live animal market where the spread of infected excrement to humans allowed the virus to cross the species barrier. But unlike the current situation, the SARS epidemic was growing for many months in China before authorities admitted they had a problem. By the time the SARS outbreak was brought under control, there were over 8,000 cases and 700 deaths in 37 countries. The WHO decided that declaring a PHEIC, introduced as part of the 2005 International Health Regulations, would help manage these situations. Previously, under legislation that was 150 years old, cholera, plague and yellow fever were contained by quarantine and embargoes at a country\u2019s borders. The 2005 legal framework focuses on containing an outbreak at its source, with an emphasis on preparedness. It requires countries to maintain necessary \u201ccore capacities\u201d, such as the ability to diagnose infections and isolate infected patients. And rather than only being able to report specific known diseases, they can report unusual public health patterns, for example an unexpected increase in patients with severe respiratory symptoms. A PHEIC is declared when there is \u201can extraordinary event which is determined \u2026 to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease\u201d. Such a declaration raises levels of international support, enhances diplomatic efforts and security, and makes more money available to support response teams. The reason for caution is that declaring a global public health emergency can unnecessarily affect trade and tourism and imply that a country cannot control the disease on its own. But given the Chinese response of quarantining 41 million people in 13 cities, this hardly seems like a consideration here. To date, there have been five such public health emergencies declared by WHO: the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, a 2014 declaration following the resurgence of wild poliovirus, the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic, the Zika emergency of 2015 to 2016, and, after much deliberation, the 2018-19 outbreak of Ebola in Kivu. As Tedros emphasised, even without the declaration of a PHEIC, there is already a coordinated international health response to the current coronavirus outbreak. And in some ways, this looks like a model public health response with concerted action underway. The Chinese have been quick to report the outbreak in Wuhan and share all the information they have. This early release of data has allowed modellers to predict that the total number infected is already probably in the thousands. Scientists in China rapidly sequenced the new virus to determine its genetic make-up. Their immediate publication of this information allowed others around the world to develop their own diagnostic tests. The Chinese authorities\u2019 quarantine moves underscore their determination to do everything they can to control the spread. Though whether it is possible to isolate so many people and whether at this stage it will help control the epidemic is uncertain. In the UK and other countries, passengers on flights coming directly from Wuhan were undergoing some health screening and being given information about what to do if they feel unwell. Such flights have now stopped, but these measures may need to be extended to flights from other parts of China. Several questions, however, remain unanswered, some of which will be key to the WHO\u2019s further deliberations on a PHEIC declaration over the next few weeks. It is clear that human-to-human transmission is happening \u2013 the infection has spread from patients to healthcare workers and other close contacts. What is not yet clear is how infectious the virus is. How much ongoing transmission will there be from the second patient to third, fourth and fifth contacts? And can people spread the virus before they even have symptoms? Scientists use the term reproductive rate to describe how easily a virus spreads, and the higher it is, the greater the chance of the outbreak spreading further and more quickly. The disease severity is also important. As of January 26, 56 (2.8 per cent) of 2,014 confirmed cases have died. For SARS, the case fatality rate was nearly 10 per cent. If the new coronavirus spreads rapidly but has a low case fatality rate, there will be less concern. Chinese scientists are conducting tests to determine which of the animals in the \u201cwet market\u201d in Wuhan might have been the source. There will also be questions about whether regulations to keep humans safe were being followed. After the 2003 outbreak, temporary rules were imposed to stop the sale of exotic animals, such as civet cats, which transmit SARS. But wet markets, which are usually crowded spaces selling live poultry and other animals, are popular with shoppers in Asia. About 600 people die in the UK every year from flu alone, and around the world there are hundreds of thousands of deaths. So while the emergence of a new virus will always cause alarm, the current response of public health officials and scientists in China and around the world, which incorporates everything we have learnt since SARS, should reassure the public, regardless of whether or not the WHO eventually declare this a global public health emergency. Tom Solomon is Director of the National Institute for Health Research, Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, and Professor of Neurology, Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool.

Xi made his remarks during talks with head of the World Health Organization in Beijing as a host of nations prepared to airlift their citizens from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. \"Chinese people are currently engaged in a serious struggle against an epidemic of a new type of coronavirus infection,\" Xi told WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"The epidemic is a demon, and we cannot let this demon hide,\" the Chinese leader said, pledging that the government would be transparent and release information on the virus in a \"timely\" manner. His comments came after anger simmered on Chinese social media over the handling of the health emergency by local officials in central Hubei province, where the disease first emerged in December. Some experts have praised Beijing for being more reactive and open about this virus compared to its handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-2003. But others say local cadres had earlier been more focused on projecting stability than responding to the outbreak when it began to spread earlier this month. Since then, the number of cases has soared - doubling to more than 4,500 in the past 24 hours. WHO chief Tedros praised China's response to the crisis during a meeting with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, according to state news agency Xinhua. The WHO last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted a more aggressive international response such as travel restrictions. But global concern has been growing, with Japan and Germany on Tuesday reporting the first human-to-human infections outside China. Until now, all cases in more than a dozen countries involved people who had been in or around Wuhan. In Japan, a man in his sixties contracted the virus apparently after driving two groups of tourists from the city earlier in January, the health ministry said. He was hospitalised with flu-like symptoms on Saturday. On the other side of the world, a 33-year-old German man caught the disease off a Chinese colleague from Shanghai who visited Germany last week, according to health officials. The development came after countries including Sri Lanka, Malaysia and the Philippines announced tighter visa restrictions for people coming from China. Experts believe the virus came from a wild animal market in Wuhan and then jumped to humans, with Chinese health officials saying Tuesday that people infect each other through sneezing or coughing, and possibly through contact. Authorities initially sealed off Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province late last week, trapping more than 50 million people. China then halted international and domestic group tours. It also imposed a wide range of travel restrictions inside China, suspending long-distance bus routes and more than 2,000 train services. But with the death toll climbing and more fatalities reported in Chinese cities far away from Wuhan, authorities on Tuesday urged people to delay any foreign travel \"to protect the health and safety of Chinese and foreign people\", the National Immigration Administration said. Wuhan, meanwhile, has been turned into a near ghost-town under a lockdown that has largely confined the industrial hub's 11 million people to their homes. With a ban on car traffic, the streets were nearly deserted apart from the occasional ambulance - although the city's hospitals are overwhelmed. \"Everyone goes out wearing masks and they are worried about the infection,\" said David, a Chinese man who works in Shanghai but ended up trapped in Wuhan after it was put under quarantine. Many thousands of foreigners are also among those stuck in the city. \"It's deeply stressful,\" Joseph Pacey, a 31-year-old Briton who teaches English in Wuhan, told AFP. \"The biggest fear for me is that this thing will go on for months, and it will get harder and harder to get supplies, and to live.\" Japan said it would send a chartered flight on Tuesday evening to get about a third of its 650 nationals there. \"We will also bring aid supplies such as masks and protective suits for Chinese people as well as for Japanese nationals,\" Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said in Tokyo. If the mission succeeds, Japan would be the first country to airlift its citizens out of Wuhan. A US-chartered flight bound for California is scheduled to leave Wuhan on Wednesday with consular staff and some American citizens, a day later than previously planned. France and South Korea are also planning to fly out their citizens later this week, and several other countries, including Germany, were considering doing the same. The United States, Turkey and Germany have urged their citizens to \"reconsider\" all travel to China. Landlocked Mongolia - which is heavily dependent on trade with China - took the drastic step of closing the border with its huge neighbour to cars, as well as shutting down schools and banning large gatherings.

Taiwan and China have close economic and cultural ties, and the island has reported eight confirmed cases of the virus. All of the more than 100 deaths from the virus have been in China, centred on Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Centre said the latest patient, the eighth, was the first case of transmission on the island as in all the previous cases the people had been infected first in China. The new patient, a man in his 50s from central Taiwan, was infected by his wife after she returned from working in China and before she was subsequently diagnosed, the command centre said. The man is in a stable condition, it said. Separately, the command centre said it would extend to the rest of China an earlier warning not to go to Hubei province unless totally necessary, though Hong Kong and Macau are excluded. Taiwan has also restricted the vast majority of Chinese visitors. Last week, Taiwan's government announced a one month ban on the export of specialist masks designed to be used for medical personnel, saying it had to look after the needs of its own people first. Some pharmacies in Taiwan have said they face shortages of face masks. The government has said it is working to ensure supplies and announced it will release more masks, but limit each person to buying a maximum of three. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, visiting people to extend Lunar New Year wishes, said the government was fully prepared to deal with the virus and people should not panic. \"Our anti-epidemic work does not take holidays, and is taking place 24 hours a day,\" the presidential office quoted her as saying.","summary":"TAIPEI: Taiwan reported its first case of domestic transmission of the new coronavirus on Tuesday (Jan 28) and raised its travel warning for China, saying people should avoid going unless absolutely necessary following the outbreak of the virus there.

The screening is also being implemented in anticipation of increase in travel volume leading up to the Chinese New Year holidays, according to an Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) news release on Friday morning. At Singapore's sea checkpoints, temperature screening also started at noon, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said in response to CNA's queries. Singapore confirmed its first case of the Wuhan virus on Thursday evening - a male Wuhan resident, 66, who arrived in Singapore with his family on Jan 20. He is currently in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and is in stable condition. Two more people were confirmed to have the virus on Friday afternoon, including the 37-year-old son of the first confirmed case. Singapore authorities had announced on Thursday that border screening would be expanded to all land and sea checkpoints, while a travel advisory has been expanded for Singaporeans to avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located. ICA and MPA on Friday said the temperature screening will be conducted by \"healthcare assistants\", and suspect cases will be referred to hospitals for further assessment. MPA said inbound travellers and ship crew will be screened at all sea checkpoints, including ferry and cruise terminals, PSA terminals and Jurong Port. China's National Health Commission confirmed 830 cases of patients have been infected as of Thursday, while the death toll from the virus has risen to 25. Elsewhere, the virus has infected at least one person in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and the US. Traffic is expected to be heavy between Saturday and Tuesday during the Chinese New Year holidays. \"Coupled with the implementation of temperature screening for travellers, delays are expected and travellers are advised to check traffic conditions before embarking on their journey,\" said ICA. \"We seek travellers\u2019 understanding and cooperation to work with our officers on site.\" Health advisories have been put up at the land and sea checkpoints to advise travellers on the precautions they are to take, especially when traveling to or arriving from China. \"Singapore residents who need to travel to the affected areas are advised to regularly check MOH\u2019s website for updates. \"Travellers to China are also advised to stay vigilant, monitor developments and heed the advice of the local Chinese authorities while in China,\" said ICA.","summary":"SINGAPORE: Temperature screening for travellers arriving at Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints began at noon on Friday (Jan 24), in response to cases of the novel coronavirus pneumonia that emerged in Wuhan, China and which has since spread to other countries.

But the Saudi Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a tweet that there were no cases of the novel coronavirus so far.

SYDNEY: It is too early to make a definitive judgement about how Beijing has handled the outbreak of the potentially deadly coronavirus in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China. But it is already clear that any assessment will have to take into account not just the medical side of the virus\u2019s spread. Just as important in a public health crisis is how the authorities manage the disclosure of the information about the virus within the government, and to the public. So far, the handling of the crisis seems to have underlined one of the ongoing problems with the party-state, which places a premium on the control of information in the name of maintaining stability. In such a system, lower-level officials have no incentive to report problems until Beijing allows them to do so. Under the rule of Xi Jinping, such restrictions have only grown tighter. The difficulties of managing a public health crisis have been accentuated by this one\u2019s timing \u2013 on the eve of Lunar New Year, when literally millions of people would have been coming from Wuhan, a transport hub. Any official shutting down Wuhan would also have been shutting down the new year, a time when millions of Chinese get to reunite and celebrate as a family. Beijing has already had a test run in how not to handle a crisis of this kind, when the flu-like SARs (severe acute respiratory syndrome) began spreading in late 2002. China initially delayed responding to requests for more information from the World Health Organization when the virus first appeared in southern China in November 2002. It wasn\u2019t until February 2003 that Beijing told the WHO. As late as April, Beijing was still suppressing the numbers of people who were infected. It took a courageous doctor at the military hospital in Beijing, who informed the foreign media about the true count of patients, to force Beijing to deal with the issue openly. As a result, the epidemic took longer to control, it spread further, both in China and overseas, and more people died. There was one other lesson for the whistle-blowers. No one thanked them later. Just because they did good, they did not do well. Fast forward to 2020, and it is instructive to look at what has, and hasn\u2019t, changed. From all the reports coming out of China, albeit in a haphazard fashion, the medical and public health staff has performed with the skill that you would expect from highly skilled professionals. They isolated and identified the virus quickly. But from that point onwards, the early signs are that the SARS syndrome has been at play again. In early January, eight people in Wuhan were detained for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d about the virus. The official police report said they had been spreading \u201cfake news\u201d which had harmed social stability. Various officials in Wuhan continued to downplay the spread of the virus in the opening weeks of the year. As late as Tuesday evening, the Hubei provincial party secretary and governor hosted a lavish Lunar New Year event, despite reports that many of the performers were ill. But by then, the issue could no longer be contained. With infections and deaths rising, the authorities in Wuhan issued an order on Wednesday effectively quarantining the city, no small thing given its size and importance as a transport hub in central China. It is impossible to say, but at the moment, it certainly looks that way. Richard McGregor was the Financial Times bureau chief in Beijing and Shanghai between 2000 and 2009, and headed the Washington office after.

As many as 774 people died in the SARS epidemic, which reached nearly 30 countries. At the time, Beijing built the Xiaotangshan hospital in its northern suburbs in just a week. Within two months, it treated one-seventh of all the country's SARS patients, the Changjiang Daily said. \"It created a miracle in the history of medical science,\" the paper added. The Beijing hospital, built by 7,000 workers, was originally designed only to take people who were in recovery from SARS to relieve pressure on other hospitals. In the end it treated nearly 700 SARS patients.

A check by CNA showed that masks were out of stock at Guardian and Watsons stores in places like Paya Lebar Quarter, Clementi Mall and Tiong Bahru Plaza. Where masks were still available, at Chinatown Point for instance, long queues formed at stores. Customers were also seen snapping up hand sanitisers and thermometers. While some shops did not know when their next delivery would arrive, having sold out a fresh batch on Friday morning, others said that more deliveries were on the way. The Ministry of Health (MOH) however said in a press conference earlier in the week that there is \u201cmore than a sufficient\u201d number of N95 masks if there is a surge in demand. Typically there is an excess of six months of usage of \u201cvarious items\u201d including surgical masks during \"peace time\u201d, MOH said. \u201cThe public need not panic.

She had also used public transport in Singapore, including the MRT and taxies. \"The risk of transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low,\" said MOH. Singapore's land transport operators said they have implemented preventive measures against the Wuhan virus threat. They include a stepped-up cleaning and disinfecting schedule and issuing travel and personal hygiene advisories to employees. Both ComfortDelGro and SMRT employees have been advised to avoid all travel to Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. SMRT also said that those returning from China will undergo mandatory temperature taking. \"As a precautionary measure for our commuters, hand sanitisers are available at all MRT stations and bus interchanges,\" added SMRT. FIRST IMPORTED CASEThe latest update comes after Singapore announced on Thursday its first confirmed case, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore from Guangzhou on Jan 20. He is in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and in a stable condition, authorities said. The man stayed at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa and indicated that he had kept within the hotel vicinity. Contact tracing for his close contacts is ongoing, said MOH, adding that it has identified 46 such people as of noon on Jan 23. One of them is his 37-year-old son, who is now confirmed as having the virus. Twenty-four of those close contacts - including his eight travelling companions - had left Singapore before his case was confirmed. The health authorities in the respective countries of those 24 people have been informed and are following up, said MOH, without providing information on the countries. The ministry has quarantined 16 people and is still trying to get in touch with the remaining five contacts, it said. \"The health status of all close contacts will be closely monitored. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient,\" said MOH. \"In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status,\" it added. There have been a total of 44 suspect cases in Singapore as of noon on Jan 24, of which 13 have tested negative and test results are pending for the remaining 28, said MOH. The suspect cases are aged between 1 and 78 years old. Two of the 44 suspect cases are employees of Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa, the hotel where the first confirmed case had stayed during his trip in Singapore, said Associate Professor Vernon Lee, director of communicable diseases at MOH. The two employees had no travel history to China, he added. There is still no evidence of community spread as the suspect cases were identified early, said Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services (designate) at MOH. Singapore has formed a multi-ministerial task force to deal with the situation and expanded border screening to all land and sea checkpoints. A travel advisory has also been expanded for Singaporeans to avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located. Schools in Singapore have asked parents to declare their travel plans for the Chinese New Year weekend. Meanwhile, Singapore Airlines' budget carrier Scoot has cancelled its daily flight to Wuhan as a precautionary measure. Singapore businesses with a presence in Wuhan have also taken measures. ST Engineering, which has rail projects in Wuhan, has stopped all business commutes there. MOH said on Friday that the government has sufficient stocks of masks in the warehouses and government stockpiles. It is also working with retailers to move available stocks to the retail shops, and stocks will be available progressively from Friday, it added. On Friday, China reported that the number of people infected by the SARS-like virus had exceeded 800, with 25 deaths. The markedly higher numbers were released just hours after the World Health Organization called the outbreak \"an emergency in China\", but stopped short of declaring the situation a global health emergency. China has effectively quarantined more than 20 million people across Wuhan and some nearby cities in response to the virus, and announced measures to curb its spread nationwide as hundreds of millions of people began travelling across the country this week for the Chinese New Year holiday. Streets and shopping centres in Wuhan, a major industrial and transport hub, are now eerily quiet after authorities told residents not to leave the city of 11 million, where most of the cases have been identified. The virus, which causes respiratory symptoms similar to a cold or flu, has been linked to a seafood market in Wuhan. That market has since been shut down. The virus has spread to Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, as well as provinces in northeastern, central and southern China. Across the world, confirmed cases have also been reported in Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.","summary":"SINGAPORE: Two more people have tested positive for the Wuhan virus in Singapore, bringing the total number of cases to three, the Ministry of Health announced on Friday (Jan 24).

Most of the cases were found in Wuhan city, where the virus is believed to have originated in a market which traded in illegal wildlife. With the number of confirmed cases rising by the hundreds every day, medical supplies in the city are in short supply as people flood into hospitals waiting to be treated. At least eight hospitals in Wuhan have issued public appeals for donations of goggles, masks, medical caps and protective suits for medical workers. Alumni networks of universities in Wuhan have also posted notes on social media calling for public support. Travel in and out of the city of 11 million people has been tightly controlled since Wednesday to keep the virus from spreading. The closure of manufacturers, suppliers and distributors of medical gear over the week-long Lunar New Year holiday starting this week is exacerbating the shortages.

What is key is determining the travel history of patients, given that symptoms of the Wuhan virus are similar to the flu, said Dr Lye Tong Fong, a general practitioner at Central 24-hr Clinic Group. \"The risk factors are basically their travel history and whether they are exposed to people also with these issues,\" he said. \"It's very hard to tell based on symptoms because the ... virus symptoms are almost like flu, there is no difference.

If the patient is deemed medically stable, they will be sent to the hospital by a dedicated ambulance service, said Dr Elly. Doctors have been instructed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to call for a Singapore Civil Defence Force ambulance, if the patient is deemed to be medically unstable. Patients aged 16 years and above whose conditions are medically stable will be sent to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Emergency Department, while those below 16 years of age will be sent to KKH Children\u2019s Emergency Department. Such measures have already been put into place prior to the first confirmed case of the Wuhan virus, said doctors. \"Steps have already been circulated to all the GPs, so we all know what to do,\" said Dr Elly. According to a Jan 23 MOH circular to GPs seen by CNA, a suspect case is defined as \"a person with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of pneumonia or severe respiratory infection with breathlessness and travel to mainland China within 14 days before onset of illness\". It also refers to \"a person with an acute respiratory illness of any degree of severity who, within 14 days before onset of illness, had been to a hospital in mainland China or had close contact with a case of 2019 novel coronavirus infection\".

He reported having a sore throat while on the flight but no fever. The man developed a fever the next day and began coughing. When he went to SGH on Wednesday, he was immediately isolated, diagnosed with pneumonia and identified to MOH as a suspect case at 10pm. He tested positive for the new coronavirus at 6pm on Thursday. The man is currently in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and is in stable condition. On Friday afternoon, the ministry announced two more confirmed cases.

This includes wearing masks when unwell and practising proper hand washing, they told CNA. As of Friday, the number of suspected cases had climbed to 44, with patients aged between one to 78, according to the Health Ministry. At least 25 deaths had been reported in China as of Friday, with more than 830 confirmed cases of the virus. Cases have also been confirmed in Japan, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the United States. Below are some guidelines on how to respond to the Wuhan virus situation in Singapore, according to medical professionals. 1. DON'T PANIC Members of the public should stay calm, said infectious diseases expert Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang. \u201cBecause the Wuhan coronavirus is currently not spreading in Singapore, people should not panic and overreact,\u201d said Assoc Prof Hsu, who is programme leader of infectious diseases and co-director of global health at the National University of Singapore\u2019s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. \u201cThere is no need to stockpile masks, for example. The Ministry of Health, which has learned critical lessons from the various outbreaks that afflicted Singapore including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), will issue appropriate guidance and information in a timely manner,\u201d he added. Instead, people should keep abreast of the situation, put on masks when they feel unwell, wash their hands properly and avoid travel to Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the crisis. 2. WEAR A SURGICAL MASK Infectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam urged people to use a surgical mask instead of an N95 mask. \u201cA surgical mask works both ways. It can prevent transmission from others to you and from you to others,\u201d he said. When worn, the mask should cover the nose and mouth and rest on the chin, he added. It is important for the mask to fit well, he said. The mask can be used until it is wet inside. Once wet, it should be replaced with a new one. This means that a dry mask can be used again, Dr Leong said. He advised users to keep it in a bag without deforming it. He cautioned that drying a mask in the open could allow the germs to spread in the air. Wearing an N95 mask could be counter-productive as users might touch their faces more often from discomfort, spreading viruses on their hands, he said. 3. WASH HANDS THOROUGHLY Head of primary care at Healthway Medical Dr John Cheng said the use of anti-bacterial and alcohol-based soaps is recommended. \u201cThis is especially when coming into contact with common exchanged items such as money and utensils, and items such as handrails and lift buttons,\u201d he said. Using hand sanitisers is as effective, he added. According to Singapore\u2019s HealthHub, proper hand washing means washing hands for at least 30 seconds with soap and water. \u201cThe constant rubbing action helps soap break down the grease and dirt that carry most germs. This way, your hands don\u2019t just smell fresh, but you\u2019ll also reduce the germ count on your hands by up to 99 per cent,\u201d according to the website. The recommended eight-step hand-washing routine includes cleaning between fingers, the base of thumbs and fingernails. If there is no soap available, Dr Leong said that water alone could be effective as it can also break down viruses. 4. VACCINATIONS While there is no vaccination available for the Wuhan virus, Dr Leong said that the general public being vaccinated against influenza will reduce the risk of them from falling sick. This will reduce the burden on the healthcare system and prevent distraction from people who need attention more urgently, he added. Dr Cheng said that aside from the influenza vaccine to protect an individual against influenza-based infections, it is also important to have all other vaccinations up-to-date to safeguard your general health and immunity.

This includes wearing masks when unwell and practising proper hand washing, they told CNA. \u201cBecause the Wuhan coronavirus is currently not spreading in Singapore, people should not panic and overreact,\u201d said Assoc Prof Hsu, who is programme leader of infectious diseases and co-director of global health at the National University of Singapore\u2019s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. Instead, people should keep abreast of the situation, put on masks when they feel unwell, wash their hands properly and avoid travel to Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the crisis. 2. WEAR A SURGICAL MASK Infectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam urged people to use a surgical mask instead of an N95 mask. This means that a dry mask can be used again, Dr Leong said. Wearing an N95 mask could be counter-productive as users might touch their faces more often from discomfort, spreading viruses on their hands, he said. 3. WASH HANDS THOROUGHLY Head of primary care at Healthway Medical Dr John Cheng said the use of anti-bacterial and alcohol-based soaps is recommended. If there is no soap available, Dr Leong said that water alone could be effective as it can also break down viruses. 4. VACCINATIONS While there is no vaccination available for the Wuhan virus, Dr Leong said that the general public being vaccinated against influenza will reduce the risk of them from falling sick.","datetime":1579888740000,"retrieve_datetime":"Sun Jan 26 13:39:38 2020"},{"title":"Wuhan virus: 8 Chinese nationals who were in \u2018close contact\u2019 with Singapore\u2019s first case quarantined in JB hotel","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/asia\/wuhan-virus-8-chinese-nationals-singapore-johor-bahru-malaysia-12325404","article":"KUALA LUMPUR: Eight Chinese nationals who were in \u201cclose contact\u201d with the first person to test positive for the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore have entered Malaysia and are now being quarantined in a hotel in Johor Bahru, Malaysia\u2019s Deputy Health Minister Lee Boon Chye confirmed on Friday (Jan 24). \u201cThey are now in a hotel in Johor Bahru,\u201d he told CNA in a phone interview.

Temperature scanners have been set up at the entrance of the customs area. Travellers taking the bus only have to walk past these machines as they head to the immigration counters. Mr Zheng Pei Nan, 75, was travelling from Malaysia with his family. He told CNA he was not bothered by the scanners, part of the Mass Fever Screening System. \"It wasn't inconvenient to pass the scanners after alighting from the bus,\" he said in Mandarin, adding that the family only comes to Singapore once a year. He told CNA that he was aware of the virus but was not worried because he rarely travels to faraway countries. Mr Li Jian, a tourist from Changsha, Hunan Province in China, said he did not notice the scanners at first, but lauded them as a good idea. \"It's important to protect yourself and take your own measures,\" he said. The 50-year-old, who will be travelling around Singapore and Malaysia for six days, said he was not worried about catching the virus in Singapore. \"Singapore is a developed country,\" he said. According to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, screening measures for visitors arriving by car will ready by Friday night. Those for motorcycles, lorries and trains will be rolled out progressively, said Superintendent Joe Tan, who is deputy commander of ground operations at Tuas Checkpoint. Visitors arriving by car will have to roll down their windows to allow healthcare assistants to use Forward-Looking Infra-red Radar thermometers to check their temperature, he said. Those who have a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius and above will be taken to a holding area, where a nurse will interview them about their travel history and who they have been in contact with. Depending on the patient\u2019s answers, a doctor may carry out further checks to determine whether he or she is a suspected case and should be taken to the hospital. While waiting for the ambulance, the individual will be isolated and quarantined in another room. If the individual arrived by car, their vehicle and travel partners will also be moved to a holding area and further assessment will be carried out, said Superintendent Tan. As for affected individuals who arrive by bus, the people travelling with the suspected case are not treated as contact cases until the case is confirmed, said Associate Professor Vernon Lee, director of communicable diseases at the Ministry of Health. \u201cWe will only initiate the contact tracing proper, to label someone as a close contact, if the initial suspect case turns positive and it then becomes a confirmed case,\u201d he said. \u201cFor suspect cases they are still (treated as) suspect.

Due to the festive period, travel volume is expected to increase and there will naturally be delays, said ICA. During the year-end festive period in 2019, Tuas and Woodlands Checkpoints collectively saw about 475,000 visitors per day. While there will be minimal delays for those who arrive by bus because visitors can just walk by the temperature scanners, visitors arriving by car can expect delays because of the additional measures, said Superintendent Tan. The delay will depend on how many individuals there are in the car. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to seek citizens\u2019 understanding that there will be delays because it is an additional check that has been put in place,\u201d he added.

The pathogen appears to be a new strain of coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause diseases such as the common cold and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds in mainland China and Hong Kong between 2002 and 2003. It has been named \"2019-nCoV\". Arnaud Fontanet, head of the department of epidemiology at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, told AFP that the new strain was 80 per cent genetically identical to SARS. The symptoms caused by the new virus appears to be less aggressive as compared to SARS, according to an AFP report. These include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. However, its milder nature can also cause alarm as it allows more people to travel further before symptoms can be detected, the director of the Institute of Global Health Antoine Flahault said. The virus was first detected at a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has been shut down by authorities following the outbreak. The market offered exotic wildlife for sale, including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game, AFP reported. Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined. Two studies from China indicated that bats are the likely origin, as the strain was found to be closely related to a strain that exists in the animal. \"Bats being the native host of the Wuhan CoV (coronavirus) would be the logical and convenient reasoning, though it remains likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans,\" the researchers from several institutions in China wrote in a paper. Another study identified snakes as a possible intermediate host. Animals have been determined as the source of the virus, but human-to-human transmission of the virus is \"affirmative\", top Chinese expert on infectious diseases Zhong Nanshan told state broadcaster CCTV. It has since been passed to people who have had no contact with the market where the virus first broke out. Doctor Nathalie MacDermott of King's College London told AFP that it seems likely that the virus is spread through droplets in the air from sneezing or coughing. There is currently no vaccine for the virus. Members of the public have been advised to take steps to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes wearing masks when experiencing respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing, and observe good hygiene practices, like washing their hands frequently. They should also avoid places and close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness. Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Health has issued an advisory asking travellers to avoid contact with live animals and consuming raw and undercooked meat. Those who are feeling unwell should also seek prompt medical attention, it added. More than 800 people have been infected with the coronavirus in China, with at least 26 fatalities reported. Most of the patients came from Wuhan, where the virus started. It has since spread to other major cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Transport in and out of Wuhan have ceased operations in an effort to prevent and control the spread of the virus. Authorities have also locked down several cities in Hubei province as a response to the outbreak. Entertainment venues such as Shanghai\u2019s Disneyland park, theatres and karaoke bars have also been closed down. Hubei province authorities also said they were calling off cultural performances and public cultural venues. Travel agencies in the province have suspended business and the government has announced that refunds would be given to those who cancel transport tickets. Beijing has also cancelled Chinese New Year holiday gatherings at temples. The first case of the virus reported outside of China was on Jan 13, when a Chinese woman was diagnosed with mild pneumonia after returning to Thailand from Wuhan. Another case was confirmed in Japan the next day. So far, there have been confirmed cases in nine countries outside of China. Thailand has the most reported cases, at four. Singapore reported its first case on Jan 23 \u2013 a 66-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on Jan 20 and stayed at Shangri-La\u2019s Rasa Sentosa Resort. He reported symptoms such as a sore throat and fever and went to Singapore General Hospital, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and identified as a suspect case. He was confirmed to have been infected by the virus on Jan 23. Contact tracing has been initiated to identify people who may have had close contact with the man. Two other cases have since been confirmed, one of which is the man\u2019s 37-year-old son. Border screening has been implemented in several countries, including Singapore, as a response to the outbreak. Budget carrier Scoot has cancelled its daily flight to Wuhan and schools across the island have asked parents to declare their travel plans for the Chinese New Year weekend.","summary":"SINGAPORE: A new strain of coronavirus has infected hundreds of people in China and overseas, killing more than 20 people since it was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan earlier this month.

The contagion has so far claimed 26 lives in China, sickened hundreds and has spread across several Asian countries as well as the US. \"I'm pleased to report she is clinically doing well and is in stable condition,\" said Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health of the new patient. Nancy Messonier, senior official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the agency had so far tested 63 samples from patients across 22 US states for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Eleven were found to be negative and two positive, and the CDC was working to make diagnosis kits more nationally available. At present the testing is occurring at the agency's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. The Chicago patient had travelled to Wuhan in late December before returning to the US on Jan 13, Arwady said, a few days before health screenings began at major airports for travellers originating from the central Chinese city that is at the centre of the outbreak. She began experiencing symptoms and called her health care providers, and was later admitted to hospital and placed in isolation. \"She has not taken public transportation, have not attended any large gatherings and, she has not had extended close contact with anyone outside her home since returning from China,\" added Arwady. The US confirmed its first case of the infection earlier this week, a man in his thirties from Washington state who had also travelled to Wuhan recently and also reported himself to authorities after developing mild symptoms.

Thermal cameras also scanned passengers arriving at Beijing's West Railway Station. Beijing has been praised for its response in contrast to SARS, when it took months to report the disease and initially denied WHO experts any access.

SEOUL: The website of South Korea\u2019s public health authority currently features an image of a smartly dressed woman and man wearing masks while posing in front of a mishmash of signboards written in Chinese characters. In depicting two people who are remaining calm while exercising caution as a new coronavirus afflicts the country and businesses and families brace for disruption, the government appears to be telling its people: Do not panic but do wear a mask. Next to the photo is a message imploring all South Koreans to take part in efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus, a mysterious new illness in the country. While the government is calling on the country as a whole to work to keep South Korea safe, this latest health scare underscores the reality that in this country, it is still the government that is responsible for management during challenging times. South Korea this week reported two cases of the new coronavirus that appears to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has also been reported in Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Japan. The number of cases in China grew to more than 800 this week, raising fears of a global pandemic, with even the US reporting a case. In an unfortunate bit of timing, while South Koreans are fretting over the disease this week, the country announced its weakest economic growth since the global financial crisis of a decade ago. Of late, South Korea\u2019s export-dependent economy has dealt with tremors from the trade conflict between the United States and China, as well as the country\u2019s own spat with Japan. In announcing the weak growth figures, a central bank official highlighted how the new coronavirus could pose a risk to consumption as happened in 2015 when there was an outbreak of the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in the country. South Korea\u2019s economy ought to be less vulnerable than ever to a public health crisis, as there are now ways for businesses to maintain operations with workers not being in the same physical space. This is a country with some of the most widely available Wi-Fi connection anywhere in the world, meaning that it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for workers to be just as productive from home. But despite having the technological infrastructure, South Korea has generally been slow to adapt to workplace evolutions like remote working. The country\u2019s traditions of collectivism still posit that all members of a team should, whenever possible, be together in the office for the whole day. Someone who suggests that they would prefer to spend the day at home by themselves than in the office with the team might be seen as selfish or anti-social. Beyond trust or perception issues, there is a deeper problem of a risk-averse culture in South Korea that deters employers from taking such bold moves. If South Korea seems risk averse, part of this may be explained by the country\u2019s national psyche. Having fought a destructive civil war in the early 1950s, many Koreans were left feeling that the country got a late start and had to work harder than others to develop. Having built a successful economy, Korean policymakers sometimes fear potential blowback from risky moves. That thinking is also extended to organisational cultures, where newer additions such as flexible work arrangements and remote working are deemed contrarian to and may dilute the ethos of a strong work ethic built into the national psyche. I remember years ago one successful Korean businessman telling me over dinner, \u201cYou in the West had a head start on us. We lost our country once. We cannot lose it again.\u201d That risk averse mind-set also extends to the government, which has been facing criticism for stifling innovation. A telling example is the case of Tada, a ride-sharing service. The country\u2019s large and vocal taxi lobby successfully pushed the government to enact legislation that would ban Tada from operating, arguing that the company could push traditional taxis out of business. To many, the case of Tada sent the message that the Korean government is more interested in protecting vested interests than in promoting innovation. This week, in a case local media dubbed \u201crevenge of the nerds,\u201d a group of tech entrepreneurs launched a political movement with the hope of pushing through regulatory reform that would create conditions for innovation. The founders describe being frustrated at the government who promise to ease red tape, then fail to follow through. According to one founder, South Korea has missed out on chances in cloud, big data, drones, autonomous driving, blockchain and sharing-economy technology because of the regulations. That perception of an indecisive government was also reienforced during the last epidemic outbreak in South Korea \u2013 MERS in 2015. Many here are making comparisons with that episode to question if things will be managed better this time around. The South Korean public was critical of the government in 2015 for bungling its response to the outbreak by failing to properly implement quarantine measures and not sharing information transparently with the public. Still, even though 36 people died out of 186 reported cases, MERS never snowballed into the full-blown pandemic many feared, but the uncertainty surrounding the ailment took a toll on South Korea\u2019s economy, leading to steep drops in travel and many forms of consumer spending. This time around, the country\u2019s public health authorities appear to be more decisive in taking steps to manage the risk of contagion. Airports and seaports have announced stepped-up screening measures, with separate procedures for flights from Wuhan. But that boldness and decisiveness from the government must extend wider. In times of crisis in South Korea, it is the government that is expected to lead. South Koreans look to official institutions for guidelines, and if things don\u2019t go well, it\u2019s the government that gets the blame. Similarly, businesses and organisations will also be looking to signals from the government in implementing working arrangements to contain the risks to the workforce and the economy. Ironically, the outbreak of this virus may provide the government with an opportunity to ease flexible working arrangements into the workplace culture in South Korea. That may not be a bad thing in taking a step towards a more innovative and risk-taking culture overall. More pressingly, if the South Korean government is serious about not letting the Wuhan virus take a significant hit on its economy, then implementing business continuity processes is a crucial step that has to come sooner rather than later. During MERS in 2015, the slow response and lack of transparency by the government saw measures to contain the virus such as school closures and making public the list of hospitals affected with cases carried out almost a month after the first case in May. Even then, without any clear signal from the government and lax isolation or quarantine measures, few companies implemented business continuity processes to isolate their staff from the risks. In the coming days, we will find out how much the South Korean government has learned from the experience with MERS. Yesterday, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from the government, the kind of text they send out when monsoon rains create risk of flood, or when air pollution rises to dangerous levels, imploring everyone to wash their hands, cover their mouths when coughing, and yes, wear a mask. I hope to receive another such government alert soon that advises employers to take the necessary steps to protect their business processes, including allowing their staff to work from home.

South Korea\u2019s economy ought to be less vulnerable than ever to a public health crisis, as there are now ways for businesses to maintain operations with workers not being in the same physical space. Beyond trust or perception issues, there is a deeper problem of a risk-averse culture in South Korea that deters employers from taking such bold moves. If South Korea seems risk averse, part of this may be explained by the country\u2019s national psyche. The South Korean public was critical of the government in 2015 for bungling its response to the outbreak by failing to properly implement quarantine measures and not sharing information transparently with the public. This time around, the country\u2019s public health authorities appear to be more decisive in taking steps to manage the risk of contagion. Similarly, businesses and organisations will also be looking to signals from the government in implementing working arrangements to contain the risks to the workforce and the economy. Ironically, the outbreak of this virus may provide the government with an opportunity to ease flexible working arrangements into the workplace culture in South Korea. More pressingly, if the South Korean government is serious about not letting the Wuhan virus take a significant hit on its economy, then implementing business continuity processes is a crucial step that has to come sooner rather than later. During MERS in 2015, the slow response and lack of transparency by the government saw measures to contain the virus such as school closures and making public the list of hospitals affected with cases carried out almost a month after the first case in May. Even then, without any clear signal from the government and lax isolation or quarantine measures, few companies implemented business continuity processes to isolate their staff from the risks.","datetime":1579950180000,"retrieve_datetime":"Sun Jan 26 13:40:53 2020"},{"title":"Wuhan virus: Malaysia confirms first 3 cases; all patients related to Chinese national who was Singapore's first case","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/asia\/wuhan-virus-malaysia-confirms-first-3-cases-all-patients-related-12331172","article":"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia on Saturday (Jan 25) said it had confirmed three cases of coronavirus infection, the first in the Southeast Asian country. Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said the three individuals infected were related to the 66-year-old man that was confirmed by Singaporean health authorities to have tested positive for the virus. On Friday, Malaysia\u2019s Deputy Health Minister Lee Boon Chye said eight Chinese nationals who were in close contact with the first person to test positive for the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore had entered Malaysia and were being quarantined in a hotel in Johor Bahru.

The newly identified coronavirus can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. It is still too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. On Saturday, authorities in China announced the number of cases had surged to nearly 1,300 - the majority of which were in Hubei. Health officials in the province also revealed that 15 new deaths took place in Wuhan, bringing the total number of fatalities to 41 since the outbreak began. The disease has spread to 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Wuhan and 13 other cities in Hubei have been locked down in an unprecedented quarantine effort aimed at containing the deadly respiratory contagion, which has spread to several other countries.","summary":"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia on Saturday (Jan 25) said it had confirmed three cases of coronavirus infection, the first in the Southeast Asian country.

The country's most important celebration has been all but cancelled for some 56 million people as authorities expanded travel bans in central Hubei province, now affecting 18 cities. On Saturday, when they should have been celebrating, citizens of Wuhan stood in line at a pharmacy to buy masks from employees in full-body protective suits and surgical gloves. On the eastern outskirts of Wuhan - Hubei's capital and the source of the previously unknown 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) - police manning a roadblock turned away a handful of vehicles trying to exit the city. \"Nobody can leave,\" an officer told AFP. But the police allowed some medical workers who had gone home for the holidays to re-enter the city to help at overwhelmed hospitals. \"They need us to go there, otherwise they will be too exhausted,\" said one of the women, pulling a suitcase. But the respiratory contagion continues to spread. The nationwide death toll has jumped to 41, the government said Saturday, after 15 more people died in Wuhan. Confirmed infections also surged to 1,287, up from 830 reported 24 hours earlier. Most of the deaths and overall cases have been in Hubei. In a dramatic escalation of the central government's involvement, China deployed 450 military medical staff to Wuhan, state media said. The medics, who arrived on military aircraft late Friday, include doctors with experience combating SARS or Ebola and will be dispatched to hospitals that are reportedly short on beds due to a crush of infected patients and worried locals. The National Health Commission also ordered nationwide measures to detect people carrying the virus on planes, trains and buses across the country. \"Everyone is just trying to protect themselves,\" said a man in a surgical mask at a Wuhan pharmacy where customers were stocking up on masks, gloves and disinfectant. But the man, who declined to give his name, expressed confidence in Chinese authorities. \"The government is handling this. It's not a problem.\" The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003 and spread to a number of other countries. It has now spread nationwide and to a dozen other countries, with France saying three cases had been confirmed there - the first known European infections. Australia and Malaysia on Saturday became the latest countries to confirm infections. Beijing's Forbidden City, Shanghai Disneyland, and a section of the Great Wall are among many attractions that have closed as a precaution. The New Year is usually a joyous occasion for family reunions, but not for many in Wuhan. \"Usually we celebrate as a family. Now, because of the virus I'm not even visiting my parents,\" said Wang Fang, a 49-year-old Wuhan native. \"It'll be great just to be able to make it through (the outbreak).\" China's aggressive response has won praise, especially compared to its handling of SARS, when it was accused of reacting sluggishly and stonewalling the international community. \"China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,\" US President Donald Trump tweeted, hours after the United States confirmed its second case. \"The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency,\" he added. \"It will all work out well.\" China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! The virus emerged at a bad time for containment, with hundreds of millions of Chinese rushing home for the holiday. The timing could limit the economic impact, however, since much of China normally shuts down anyway during the roughly week-long break. The outbreak emerged in late December, traced to a Wuhan seafood and live animal market that sold a vast range of exotic animals and other bushmeat. The World Health Organization on Thursday stopped short of declaring a global emergency, which would have prompted greater international cooperation, including possible trade and travel restrictions. Wuhan resembles a ghost town due to the clampdown, but hospitals bustled with worried patients being screened by staff wearing full-body protective suits. The city's Guiyuan Temple is normally thronged for the Lunar New Year with tens of thousands of devotees paying respects to a deity associated with wealth. But police manning a roadblock on Saturday turned away AFP journalists, saying the temple was closed to prevent the virus's spread.

The announcement came as city leader Carrie Lam faced criticism in some quarters over her administration's response to the crisis. Of the five people who have tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong so far, four arrived via a newly built high-speed train terminal which connects with the mainland. That led to calls from some medical experts and politicians to limit, or even halt, arrivals from China, the epicentre of the outbreak with 41 people dead. Lam held emergency meetings with health officials on Saturday morning after returning from Davos. \"Today I declare the lifting of the response level to emergency,\" she told reporters. Schools and universities, which are currently on a Lunar New Year break, would remain closed until Feb 17, Lam said. All mainland arrivals to Hong Kong will now need to sign health declaration forms, she added, while public events including a new year gala and next month's marathon, would also be called off. \"We haven't seen serious and widespread infections (in Hong Kong), but we are taking this seriously and we hope to be ahead of the epidemic,\" Lam said. Hong Kong has a recent experience of deadly viral outbreaks. Nearly 300 people were killed by SARS in 2003, a tragedy that left a profound psychological impact on one of the most densely populated places on earth. The city's ability to combat the crisis was hampered by moves in mainland China to cover up and play down the outbreak, leaving a lasting legacy of distrust among many Hong Kongers. Animosity towards the mainland has intensified in recent years as Beijing tightens political control over the semi-autonomous territory. The outbreak also comes at a sensitive time for Lam, who currently boasts record low approval ratings after seven months of pro-democracy protests. \"We must stand united so that we can prevent and control the disease,\" she said, in a nod to the political unrest. The often violent protests have battered Hong Kong's reputation for stability and helped tip it into recession, with the recent virus outbreak compounding the city's economic woes. Hospitals are already struggling with the winter flu season, but officials are isolating anyone with a history of travel to central China and those exhibiting respiratory tract infections that look similar to the virus. So far some 300 people have been tested and monitored for the virus. Quarantine centres have been set up in remote holiday parks for anyone found to have come into close contact with people who tested positive. On Saturday, officials announced a newly built but still-empty public housing block would be used for medical staff on the frontline who did not want to risk returning to their families.","summary":"HONG KONG: Hong Kong on Saturday (Jan 25) declared the outbreak of a mystery virus as an \"emergency\" - the city's highest warning tier - as authorities ramped up measures aimed at reducing the risk of further infections spreading.

AFP saw a steady trickle of cars approaching the roadblocks around 20km east of the city centre on Saturday morning, only for police in fluorescent jackets wearing masks to tell them to turn around. The barricade, at one of the tolls for highways exiting the city, was blocked with red and yellow plastic barriers and cones. \"Nobody can leave,\" a policeman told AFP. A stray dog ran across the empty road in front of the roadblocks, which were shrouded in grey fog and drizzle. AFP journalists only saw two vehicles allowed to pass the roadblock, including a white van which an officer said was \"buying medicines\" and would later return to the city. Authorities extended transport bans to 17 other cities around Wuhan in a gargantuan effort to control the SARS-like virus, restricting travel for around 56 million in Hubei province. While there are restrictions on anyone leaving Wuhan, a few people were allowed to enter the city through the barricade: Desperately needed medical workers whose holidays were cut short to help overwhelmed hospitals. An empty bus was allowed to pass the roadblock into Wuhan after showing documentation to the police at the roadblock. Three young nurses who crossed the barrier on foot told AFP they were going to two hospitals. Two of them were waiting for a friend to pick them up. \"We went to our hometowns for holidays before the ban on transportation, but because of the epidemic we have to come back quickly to Wuhan,\" said one. Dragging wheelie cases behind them, they were holding their coat hoods up against the rain. \"They need us to go there, otherwise they will be too exhausted,\" another medical worker who didn't want to be named told AFP. In the city centre, temples were closed and holiday festivities cancelled, but people gathered instead in pharmacies to buy medical supplies. At one store, customers queued at the cash register while staff in protective gear retrieved what they needed and brought it out to them. Pharmacy staff were in full body suits and gloves, wearing two sets of face masks. People rifled through boxes of face masks, comparing different makes and models. Full body suits had already sold out. Amid fears of rising prices and lack of products, some sales were being restricted and officials were regulating sales. \"My duty is to supervise the price of what pharmacists are selling,\" said Li Xiang, a market supervisor at one pharmacy. \"Goods must be from official channels and prices shall not be hiked.\" Li told AFP that the government was making an effort to \"maintain social stability and safeguard people's lives.\" A popular traditional Chinese medicine for treating fevers was being restricted to only two boxes per person to manage high demand. A local radio station played in the pharmacy ran an advert reminding people to wear a mask. \"Everyone is just trying to protect themselves,\" said one man in a surgical mask who declined to give his name. \"The government is in control of this. It's not a problem,\" he added. Meanwhile, in a taxi, a rap song playing on the radio echoed the patriotic fervour, telling people not to be afraid of the virus. \"Wuhan people are strong enough to fight and defeat it,\" the rapper chanted.","summary":"WUHAN: Police at a roadblock on the outskirts of Wuhan turned away cars trying to leave the virus-stricken city on Saturday (Jan 25), as other anxious residents trapped inside spent the Chinese New Year stocking up on masks and medical supplies.

As many as 774 people died in the SARS epidemic, which reached nearly 30 countries. At the time, Beijing built the Xiaotangshan hospital in its northern suburbs in just a week. Within two months, it treated one-seventh of all the country's SARS patients, the Changjiang Daily said. \"It created a miracle in the history of medical science,\" the paper added. The Beijing hospital, built by 7,000 workers, was originally designed only to take people who were in recovery from SARS to relieve pressure on other hospitals.

The first is a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore from Guangzhou. MOH said a total of 46 people have been identified as close contacts of the man. As of Saturday, 26 have left Singapore. Fifteen have been contacted, and isolated or quarantined. One of the 46, the man's 37-year-old son, is another confirmed case of the Wuhan virus. He and his father are under isolation in hospital and in stable condition. MOH said it has identified three more close contacts associated with this patient and contacted two.

Eight of the man's travel companions had travelled to Johor Bahru, where they were quarantined in a hotel. Three of them - the man's wife and two grandchildren - tested positive for the virus. MOH reiterated that it expects to see more suspect and imported cases of the virus due to the high volume of international travel to Singapore, and urged the public to remain calm and vigilant, and to adopt good personal hygiene practices. It also advised Singaporeans not to travel to the whole of Hubei province and to exercise caution when travelling to the rest of China. Later on Saturday, the Singapore Police Force said on Facebook that the Health Ministry is aware of \"rumours circulating online that an individual has died from the novel coronavirus infection at a shopping mall in Singapore\".

China also announced further transport restrictions. With more than 1,400 people infected worldwide, most of them in China, Hong Kong declared a virus emergency, scrapped celebrations and restricted links to mainland China. Australia confirmed its first four cases on Saturday, Malaysia confirmed four and France reported Europe's first cases on Friday, as health authorities around the world scrambled to prevent a pandemic. The United States is arranging a charter flight on Sunday to bring its citizens and diplomats back from Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the epicentre of the outbreak, the Wall Street Journal reported. In Hong Kong, with five confirmed cases, the city's leader Carrie Lam said flights and high speed rail trips between the city and Wuhan will be halted. Schools in Hong Kong that are currently on Chinese New Year holidays will remain closed until Feb. 17. Xi held a politburo meeting on Saturday on measures to fight the \"accelerating\" outbreak, state television reported. As of 8pm local time on Saturday, the death toll in China had risen to 42, authorities reported. Some 1,372 people in China had been infected with the virus - traced to a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. The virus has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, and the United States. In Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, officials appealed for masks and protective suits. \"We are steadily pushing forward the disease control and prevention ... But right now we are facing an extremely severe public health crisis,\" Hu Yinghai, deputy director-general of the Civil Affairs Department, told a news briefing. The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. Ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing said it was halting inter-city services to and from Beijing from Sunday, while the capital will also stop running inter-province shuttle buses. State broadcaster CCTV, citing an announcement from China's tourism industry association, said the country would halt all group tours, both at home and abroad, from Monday. Wuhan said it would ban non-essential vehicles from its downtown starting Sunday, further paralysing a city of 11 million that has been on virtual lockdown since Thursday, with nearly all flights cancelled and checkpoints blocking the main roads leading out of town. Authorities have since imposed transport restrictions on nearly all of Hubei province, which has a population of 59 million. Australia confirmed its first four cases in two different cities on Saturday, and the country's chief health official said he expected more cases as Australia is a popular destination for Chinese tourists. State-run China Global Television Network reported on Saturday that a doctor who had been treating patients in Wuhan, 62-year-old Liang Wudong, had died from the virus. US coffee chain Starbucks said it was closing all its outlets in Hubei province for the week-long Chinese New Year holiday, following a similar move by McDonald's in five Hubei cities. Workers in white protective suits checked temperatures of passengers entering the subway at Beijing's central railway station on Saturday, while some train services in the eastern Yangtze River Delta region were suspended, the local railway operator said. There are fears transmission could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel during the holiday, although many have cancelled their plans. Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of such screenings. In an illustration of how such efforts could miss cases, doctors at a Paris hospital said that two of the three Chinese nationals in France who have been diagnosed with the virus had arrived in the country without showing symptoms. The World Health Organisation this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency. A report by infectious disease specialists at Imperial College, London on Saturday said that despite this, the epidemic \"represents a clear and ongoing global health threat\" adding: \"It is uncertain at the current time whether it is possible to contain the continuing epidemic within China.\" While China has called for transparency in managing the crisis, after cover-up of the 2002\/2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome spread, officials in Wuhan have been criticised for their handling of the current outbreak. In rare public dissent, a senior journalist at a Hubei newspaper run by the ruling Communist Party called on Friday for a \"immediate\" change of leadership in Wuhan on the Twitter-like Weibo. The post was later removed. Hubei province, where authorities are rushing to build a 1,000 bed hospital in six days, announced on Saturday that there were 658 patients affected by the virus in treatment, 57 of whom were critically ill. Shanghai Disneyland was closed from Saturday. Beijing's Lama Temple, where people make offerings for the new year, has also closed, as have some other temples.

The popular Tibetan Buddhist temple, which had more than 80,000 visitors during the holiday last year, is usually packed with crowds queuing to burn incense for good luck. The epicentre of the SARS-like virus is in central China, but it has spread to other regions, prompting authorities as far as the nation's northern capital to close tourist attractions and cancel public events to prevent further contagion from a disease that has killed dozens and infected more than 1,000. Authorities even decided to stop long-distance bus services to and from the capital of 20 million from Sunday as part of efforts to control the spread of the virus, state media reported. Security guards loitered in front of Beijing's Lama Temple on Chinese New Year, shooing away anyone who lingered for too long. A red sign on the closed front gate said the temple was closed until further notice \"in order to guarantee the physical health of the religious masses and the Buddhist monks.\" \"It doesn't feel like the New Year,\" said a 21-year-old woman in a long beige jacket, who only gave her surname Li. Wearing a white surgical mask, Li told AFP she had planned to burn incense at Lama Temple, before realising it was closed. In the capital of 20 million, where health authorities have reported at least 39 infected patients, famous landmarks were closed to prevent the virus from spreading, including the historic Forbidden City and a section of the Great Wall. The Ming Tombs and Yinshan Pagoda are also not open to visitors. Beijing Ditan and Longtan Temple Fairs - held for roughly three decades according to state media - were also cancelled. In central Hubei province, where the majority of cases have emerged, more drastic measures were taken: travel restrictions have been imposed in cities housing 56 million people. \"When we left home, it (the virus) wasn't that serious yet,\" said a 40-year-old woman, who arrived in Beijing from southern Guangdong province before the closures began. \"I am worried, but I also feel like worrying too much is useless,\" she added. \"It's better to face it head-on.\" At a shopping district near Beijing's Houhai lake, where tourists buy street food and souvenirs, many restaurants were open on the first day of Spring Festival. The narrow streets were festooned with red lanterns and Chinese flags, while food stalls sold snacks like stinky tofu and sugar-coated fruit. But there were fewer people than normal, pointed out Huo, a 63-year-old Beijing native who only offered his surname. \"There's definitely an impact (from the virus),\" he said. \"Look at how few people there are.\" But when asked whether he was worried about the virus, Huo remained nonchalant. \"In 2003, SARS was much worse,\" he told AFP, referring to an outbreak that killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong. \"I don't have to wear a mask because everyone else is,\" joked another man, who had travelled from eastern Shandong province. \"There's no point in worrying,\" he added. Some tourists also felt they had no choice but to go through with travel plans to Beijing despite the closures and risk of infection. At the upscale Taikoo Li shopping district, a 26-year-old woman said her hotel refused to refund her booking. \"Some people are over-panicking,\" she told AFP, explaining that some friends were worried about getting infected, even while staying at home. \"The atmosphere is a bit tense this year,\" agreed another woman, a 47-year-old who gave her surname as Zhang.

The latest case is a 36-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with his family on Wednesday, the ministry said. \u201cHe is currently warded in an isolation room at Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) and his condition is stable,\u201d said MOH. The man, who had not displayed any symptoms of the Wuhan virus during his flight to Singapore, had stayed at Village Hotel Sentosa after his arrival. However, he developed a cough on Thursday and went to the SKH Emergency Department the following day, where he was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated. Subsequent tests confirmed the Wuhan coronavirus infection at about 9.30pm on Saturday. MOH said it has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify those who had close contact with him. There have been a total of 64 suspect cases in Singapore as of 10pm on Jan 25, of which 29 have tested negative and test results are pending for the remaining 31, said MOH on its website. On Jan 24, MOH announced that two people tested positive for the Wuhan virus in Singapore after the first case was confirmed. The two patients include the 37-year-old son of the first confirmed case and a 53-year-old woman - all three also having travelled from Wuhan. The woman had reported that she was asymptomatic during the flight to Singapore, but developed a fever, cough and chills in the afternoon of her arrival on Jan 21, MOH said. She had stayed at J8 Hotel and visited Orchard Road, Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay, and had also used public transport in Singapore, including the MRT and taxies. \"The risk of transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low,\" said MOH.

The French firm, which makes brands including Peugeot and Citroen, said in a statement the evacuation was being \"implemented in full cooperation with the Chinese authorities and French consulate general\" and involved 38 people made up of staff members and their families working in the Wuhan region. They would be quarantined in the city of Changsha, around 300 kilometres (180 miles) from Wuhan where the virus originated, before being allowed to return \"to their countries of origin\", the company said in a statement. The first cases to be confirmed in Europe were announced by French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn on Friday. Others were \"being monitored\", said Paris emergency service chief Pierre Cali, without giving an exact figure. \"We are going to have patients suspected of having the virus, there are going to be (more) cases,\" warned Yazdan Yazdanpanah, head of infectious diseases at Paris's Bichat hospital where two of the three cases were being treated.

The other case involved a 48-year-old man, originally from China, who returned to France on January 22 after having \"passed through Wuhan\", according to Buzyn.

Fifteen more people have died and at least 688 new cases of the coronavirus have now been confirmed, according to the National Health Commission. Among the new deaths, 13 were in Hubei, the province at the heart of the outbreak, while Shanghai reported its first death. Chinese authorities have so far reported 1,975 cases nationwide. President Xi Jinping warned on Saturday that China faced a \"grave situation\" as authorities raced to contain a respiratory illness that has caused the widespread abandonment of Chinese New Year celebrations nationwide and overwhelmed health facilities in Hubei. The contagion remained centred on the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan, which accounted for seven of the new deaths and 46 of the new confirmed cases, said the Hubei Health Commission. Wuhan and more than a dozen other cities in the province have been locked down in a rapidly expanding quarantine effort marked by transport shutdowns and other restrictions on movement. A second major Chinese city is set to halt long-distance buses as China scrambles to contain the deadly virus. Starting Monday, Tianjin - a city of about 15 million inhabitants - will suspend long-distance buses and chartered buses that enter and leave the city, local officials said on their official Twitter-like Weibo account, a day after Beijing announced a similar measure. China also announced a partial lockdown in the southern city of Shantou, the first such measure taken outside the epicentre of the disease. From midnight, non-emergency vehicles will be prohibited from entering the city of 5.6 million people, which is a 1,100-kilometre drive from Wuhan, the heart of the epidemic. People arriving at Shantou train stations will be screened and \"urged to return\", said city authorities. Buses, ferries, public transport and taxis will be suspended, Shantou authorities said on their official social media account. The measures are to \"spare no efforts in doing a good job of preventing and controlling\" the epidemic, Shantou officials said, and to \"cut off the channels of spreading the virus\". The previously unknown virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) pathogen, which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. It also has struck at possibly the worst time for China, when hundreds of millions of people are travelling across the country or overseas to celebrate the Chinese New Year holiday, China's most important festival. Instead of New Year revelry, Wuhan has been seized by an eerie calm that deepened on Sunday as new restrictions banned most road traffic in the metropolis of 11 million. Loudspeakers broke the silence by offering tips slathered with bravado. \"Do not believe in rumours. Do not spread rumours. If you feel unwell, go to the hospital in time,\" the message said. \"Wuhan is a city that dares to face difficulties and keeps overcoming them,\" the female voice added, mentioning the deadly 2002-03 SARS epidemic and 1998 Yangtze River flooding. But some foreigners in Wuhan expressed deep concern, saying they feared going outside even though their food supplies were running low. \"The bustling city looks like a ghost town from my window. The shops are all shut down,\" Bangladeshi doctoral candidate Israt Zahan told AFP by phone. \"I am rationing the food at my home. It will last for two days, then I don't know what I will do.\" Hundreds of military doctors have been sent to Hubei and authorities are rushing to build a pair of field hospitals to deal with the crisis as patients swamp local medical facilities.

But to be able to contain the epidemic and turn the tide of infections, control measures would have to halt transmission in at least 60 per cent of cases.

Ferguson's team suggest as many as 4,000 people in Wuhan were already infected by Jan 18 and that on average each case was infecting two or three others. A second study by researchers at Britain's Lancaster University also calculated the contagion rate at 2.5 new people on average being infected by each person already infected. \"Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan, we predict (it) will be substantially larger by Feb. 4,\" the scientists wrote.

Here's what China has been doing as it struggles to contain the virus that has spread within the country and overseas. Thirteen cities have been quarantined in an attempt to contain the virus. Transport such as trains, buses and passenger boats were halted from leaving and entering Wuhan as the city was placed under effective lockdown. Those already on their way have been ordered to return to their starting points. Airlines, including Singapore Airlines\u2019 budget arm Scoot, have cancelled flights in and out of the city. Other cities in Hubei province \u2013 such as Zhijiang, Xiantao and Huanggang \u2013 have also experienced lockdowns and transport closures, affecting about 56 million people. The province has announced it will stop operating online taxis and impose passenger restrictions on the roads. The southern city of Shantou announced a partial lockdown on Jan 26, the first city to implement such a measure outside the epicentre for the disease. Authorities in Beijing, Xi\u2019an and Tianjin have also announced they are suspending long-distance and chartered buses that enter and leave their cities. The Chinese government has dispatched 450 military medics to Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus. This is in response to the rising number of cases in the city, where hospitals are overwhelmed and medical supplies are running low. Many of these medics are experienced in dealing with infectious diseases such as SARS and Ebola. People waiting at a hospital in Wuhan said they have been waiting hours, even days, to see the doctor. The city is building two makeshift hospitals to add hundreds of beds to meet demand. Work on the first facility began on Friday (Jan 24) and it could be ready in just over a week, say state media. It is being built around a holiday complex originally intended for local workers. Prefabricated buildings, which will have 1,000 beds, will be put up, said the Changjiang Daily. \"The construction of this project is to solve the shortage of existing medical resources,\" the report said. \"Because it will be prefabricated buildings, it will not only be built fast but it also won't cost much.\" Several tourist spots in the country have been shut down as a result of the outbreak. Shanghai Disneyland said on its website it would temporarily close from Saturday \"in response to the prevention and control of the disease outbreak and in order to ensure the health and safety\" of its guests and staff.

The virus, which has infected more than 2,000 people globally and killed 56 people in China, has been traced to a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. It has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as to Singapore, the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Australia, France and Canada. The World Health Organization this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency, but some health experts question whether China can continue to contain the epidemic. On Sunday, China confirmed 1,975 cases of patients infected with the new coronavirus as of Jan 25, while the death toll from the virus has risen to 56, state broadcaster CCTV reported. The outbreak has prompted widening curbs on movements within China, with Wuhan, a city of 11 million, on virtual lockdown, with transports links all-but severed except for emergency vehicles. Health authorities in Beijing urged people not to shake hands but instead salute using a traditional cupped-hand gesture. The advice was sent in a text message that went out to mobile phone users in the city on Sunday morning. The outbreak has overshadowed the start of the Chinese New Year, which is typically a festive time of year, with public events cancelled and many tourist sites shut. Many people on social media have been calling for the week-long holiday to be extended to help prevent further spread of the virus. WeChat, China's ubiquitous messaging app, warned that it could ban accounts spreading rumours. China has called for transparency in managing the crisis, after a cover-up of the spread of the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002\/2003 eroded public trust, but officials in Wuhan have been criticised for their handling of the current outbreak. \"People in my hometown all suspect the real infected patients number given by authorities,\" said Violet Li, who lives in the Wuhan district where the seafood market is located. \"I go out with a mask twice a day to walk the dog - that's the only outdoor activity,\" she told Reuters by text message. Many cinemas across China are also closed with major film premieres postponed, slashing revenues. Theatres in the country took in just 1.81 million yuan (US$262,167) from tickets on Saturday, a tiny fraction of the 1.46 billion yuan on Chinese New Year's Day in 2019, according to data from movie-ticketing company Maoyan. Cruise operators including Royal Caribbean Cruises, Costa Cruises, MSC Cruises and Astro Ocean Cruises said that they cancelled a combined 12 cruises that had been scheduled to embark from Chinese ports before Feb 2. On Saturday, Hong Kong declared a virus emergency, scrapped celebrations and restricted links to mainland China. Hong Kong Disneyland and the city's Ocean Park theme park were closed on Sunday. Shanghai Disneyland, which expected 100,000 visitors daily through the Chinese New Year holidays, has already closed. In Hong Kong, with five confirmed cases, the city's leader Carrie Lam said on Saturday that flights and high speed rail trips between the city and Wuhan will be halted. Schools in Hong Kong that are currently on Chinese New Year holidays will remain closed until Feb 17. On Saturday, Canada declared the first \"presumptive\" confirmed case of the virus in a resident who had returned from Wuhan. The patient, a male in his 50s, arrived in Toronto on Jan 22 and was hospitalised the next day after developing symptoms of respiratory illness, officials said. Australia confirmed its first four cases on Saturday, Malaysia confirmed four and France reported Europe's first cases on Friday. The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. There are fears transmission could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel during the holiday, although many have cancelled their plans and airlines and railways in China are providing full refunds for tickets. Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of such screenings. In an illustration of how such efforts could miss cases, doctors at a Paris hospital said two of the three Chinese nationals in France who have been diagnosed with the virus had arrived in the country without showing any symptoms. A report by infectious disease specialists at Imperial College, London on Saturday said the epidemic \"represents a clear and ongoing global health threat,\" adding: \"It is uncertain at the current time whether it is possible to contain the continuing epidemic within China.\" Full coverage: https:\/\/cna.asia\/wuhan-virus","summary":"BEIJING: China on Sunday (Jan 26) banned wildlife trade nationwide in markets, supermarkets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms due to the coronavirus outbreak, the country's market watchdog, agricultural ministry, and forestry bureau said in a joint statement.

Like SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which was traced to bats and civets, the virus that has killed dozens in China and infected almost 2,000 people is believed to have originated in animals trafficked for food. Final findings are yet to be announced, but Chinese health officials believe it came from wildlife sold illegally at a market in the central city of Wuhan that offered enough animals to fill a zoo, including civets, rats, snakes, giant salamanders and live wolf pups. The so-called \"bushmeat\" trade, plus broader human encroachment on wild habitats, is bringing us into ever-closer contact with animal viruses that can spread rapidly in our uber-connected world, said Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a global NGO focused on infectious disease prevention. The Global Virome Project, a worldwide effort to increase preparedness for pandemics, which Daszak is a part of, estimates there are 1.7 million undiscovered viruses in wildlife, nearly half of which could be harmful to humans. Daszak said the project's research indicates we can expect around five new animal-borne pathogens to infect humanity each year. \"The new normal is that pandemics are going to happen more frequently,\" he said. \"We are making contact with animals that carry these viruses more, and more, and more.\" Viruses are a natural part of the environment, and not all are the stuff of sci-fi horror. But the recent track record of animal-hosted viruses that \"jump\" to humans is sobering. Like SARS, which killed hundreds in China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003, Ebola also was traced to bats, while HIV has roots in African primates. Today, more than 60 per cent of new emerging human infectious diseases reach us via animals, scientists say. Even familiar menu items like poultry and cattle - whose pathogens we have largely adapted to over millennia - occasionally throw a curveball, like bird flu or mad-cow disease. \"For the sake of these wild species' future, and for human health, we need to reduce consumption of these wild animals,\" said Diana Bell, a wildlife disease and conservation biologist at University of East Anglia who has studied SARS, Ebola and other pathogens. \"But, 17 years on (from SARS), apparently that hasn't happened.\" Wild-meat consumption itself is not necessarily dangerous - most viruses die once their host is killed. But pathogens can jump to humans during the capture, transportation, or slaughter of animals, especially if sanitation is poor or protective equipment not used. With scrutiny rising amid the viral outbreak, China on Sunday ordered a temporary ban on wildlife trading until the viral epidemic eases. But conservationists say China has repeatedly failed to deliver on pledges to crack down. Chinese authorities have addressed the problem partly by encouraging a farmed-animal industry. This has included for endangered species like tigers, whose parts are prized in China and other Asian countries as aphrodisiacs or for other uses. But that comes with its own downside, by providing a channel for more sought-after wild-caught beasts to be laundered as \"farmed\", Bell said. She added that wildlife traders also had become more savvy, avoiding market scrutiny by selling directly to restaurants. Environmental groups say Chinese demand, fuelled by rising consumer buying power, is the biggest driver of the global bushmeat trade today. Some rare species have been prized in China as delicacies or for unproved health benefits since ancient times. Traditionally, a host gains \"face\" by serving guests or business partners expensive, hard-to-acquire wild fare. Yang Zhanqiu, a pathogen biologist at Wuhan University, said modern demand also is bolstered by widespread distrust of a Chinese food industry tarnished by years of repeated safety scandals. \"People will think: Wild is natural, natural is safe,\" Yang said. \"Everyone wants to eat better, so there is a market for wild animals.\" Daszak said \"it's very difficult to stop an activity with 5,000 years of cultural significance\". But recent surveys strongly indicate that China's younger generation - swayed partly by animal-rights campaigns involving popular Chinese celebrities - are much less inclined to tuck into bat, rat, or salamander, he added. \"I think that in 50 years this will be a thing of the past,\" Daszak said. \"The problem is that we live in such an interconnected world today that any pandemic like this can spread globally in three weeks.\"","summary":"SHANGHAI: The animal-borne SARS virus 17 years ago was supposed to be a wake-up call about consuming wildlife as food, but scientists say China's latest epidemic indicates that the practice remains widespread and a growing risk to human health.

The city of 11 million is the epicentre of the new SARS-like epidemic and has been in quarantine since Thursday (Jan 23) - with nobody allowed to leave as the government tries to contain its spread. At one Wuhan hospital AFP visited, there were long queues of sick patients, many coughing, with overwhelmed staff unable to process them quickly. Outside the Red Cross facility - which is one of the hospitals people are sent to for initial tests if they show signs of infection - patients told AFP they felt exasperated and helpless. \"It has been two days since I slept, and I have been wandering from hospital to hospital,\" said a man in his 30s, who was trying to see a doctor because he was worried he might be infected. \"At this rate, my turn will be tomorrow morning at best.\" Nearly 2,000 people have been infected across the country and 56 have died - mostly in Hubei. Those who spoke to AFP told of extremely long queues and disorganisation. One spoke of a fear that sick patients with fevers will infect each other while waiting in long queues, even if they didn't have the coronavirus when they first arrived at the hospital. Another man said he had seen several people faint while waiting. Many people carried their own plastic stools to sit on, while one pragmatic man had brought a lounge chair with him. Volunteers were taking patients to the hospital on Sunday after cars were ordered off the road. Authorised neighbourhood committees were transporting patients instead. \"There are no cars, so we are responsible for taking them there,\" said one volunteer, 40-year-old Yin Yu. The health crisis struck just before Chinese New Year - the most important date of the Chinese calendar, when millions of workers travel across the country to visit family - putting more pressure on the understaffed hospital. \"It takes at least five hours to see a doctor,\" one woman, who didn't want to be named, told AFP. The woman, who was with her son, said the management of the hospital was \"really messy\". An old man wearing a Mao cap said he had waited all day to see a doctor, only to be sent home because of a \"lack of room\". AFP saw some patients inside the hospital who were without masks, despite city orders that anyone going out must wear them. Patients were taking their own temperatures with mercury thermometers, by mouth or armpit, and there were no checks on anyone entering or leaving the hospital. And there was no sign that the flow of patients would ease up. \"Do not spread rumours. If you feel unwell, go to the hospital in time,\" was the message played over loudspeakers in the city. Wuhan hospitals are \"saturated\", the Municipal Health Commission admitted to the People's Daily. Faced with a congested medical system, authorities are racing to build two hospitals of over a thousand beds each within two weeks, and deployed hundreds of medical reinforcements to Wuhan. Patients say more capacity is sorely needed. \"There is no more space, the staff are overwhelmed, there is a shortage of some medicine, and patients are being left to fend for themselves,\" said one 30-year-old. He showed AFP pictures on his smartphone of a patient lying on the floor attached to a respiratory device. AFP was unable to verify the authenticity of the photograph. The vast majority of cases have been reported in Hubei, and several Wuhan residents said they think the figure is far below the real number. One person said there were \"many deaths\" in the hospital, and he did not believe the bodies were properly removed. \"It was like a horror movie,\" he said.","summary":"WUHAN: Overwhelmed staff members, patients waiting for hours to see a doctor, people fending for themselves: Wuhan residents describe scenes of chaos from one swamped hospital struggling to cope with crowds who may be infected by the new coronavirus.

Defying the threat from a contagious respiratory illness that broke out in the city and has killed dozens of people, Zhang and other Wuhan residents are pitching in by driving sick fellow citizens to hospital. \"We're from Wuhan, and even though you guys are here to help us, our own citizens should also come out to (help),\" Zhang Lin told AFP journalists as he waited for a patient to emerge from a clinic for the drive back home. \"There has to be someone who does this.\" The 48-year-old Zhang and others have been enlisted by the government to provide the free service, and it is sorely needed. Wuhan has for days been the nucleus of a transport lockdown that began in the city of 11 million and has since been expanded to much of the rest of Hubei province, in an attempt to cut off transmission routes for the virus. Wuhan's public transport system has been halted, taxi services curtailed and, on Sunday, new restrictions were introduced banning most cars from the streets. Difficulty getting around adds another challenge for sick people who, even after they reach overwhelmed hospitals, may need to wait hours to see hard-pressed doctors. But drivers like Yin Yu have obtained special dispensation to drive for humanitarian reasons. \"There are no cars, so we are responsible for sending them there ... and taking them back. This is all for free,\" said Yin, 40. To many Chinese, such can-do attitudes are hardly surprising for Wuhan. The city, located in the centre of the country on the Yangtze River, was the starting point for an armed rebellion against the Qing dynasty in 1911 that ended imperial rule - and gave the city's people a reputation for toughness. That toughness was referenced in a public announcement blaring from a loudspeaker in the city on Sunday, which offered tips on hygiene and seeking medical care, but also a dose of civic pride. \"Wuhan is a city that dares to face difficulties and keeps overcoming them,\" said a female voice. \"This is not the first time we have faced a similar situation. In 1998 we fought against extreme (Yangtze River) flooding. In 2003 we fought SARS,\" it said, referring to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a national viral epidemic similar to the current one.","summary":"WUHAN, Hubei: Citizens of China's virus-stricken city of Wuhan have been told to stay indoors, avoid strangers and keep their cars off the road, but locals like Zhang Lin are refusing to sit by and watch their hometown suffer.

The total number of confirmed cases in China rose about 30 per cent to more than 2,700, about half of them in Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan. As worries grew around the world, Chinese territory Hong Kong, which has had eight confirmed cases, banned entry to people who had visited Hubei in the past 14 days. The ban does not cover Hong Kong residents. The number of deaths from the flu-like virus in Hubei climbed to 76 from 56, health officials said, with five deaths elsewhere in China, including the southern island province of Hainan, which reported its first fatality on Monday. While a small number of cases have been confirmed in more than 10 countries, linked to people who travelled from Wuhan, no deaths have been reported elsewhere.

NORWICH: The SARS outbreak in 2002 to 2003 was the first global pandemic of the 21st century. There were over 8,400 reported cases and 11 per cent of those infected with the virus died. Its cause was a newly identified coronavirus (a type of virus that causes respiratory infections): SARS Co-V. Early cases were linked to wildlife markets and restaurants in Guangdong, China, where researchers found SARS-like coronaviruses in animals including masked palm civets and a racoon dog. A Chinese government team subsequently reported that 66 out of 508 wildlife handlers tested in other markets across Guangdong were positive for antibodies to the SARS virus. The Chinese authorities responded by imposing a temporary ban on the hunting, sale, transportation and export of all wild animals in southern China. They also quarantined or culled civets reared for human consumption in the many civet farms across the area. Civets testing positive for SARS may have secondary infections rather being than the source of the virus. They were probably infected during the \u201cspeed dating\u201d of zoonotic viruses circulating among the jumble of different animal species packed together at markets or while being transported to markets, often in China. At the Royal Society\u2019s international conference on Lessons from SARS in 2004 and in the related publication, we emphasised that wildlife trade was a threat to human health and a primary cause of biodiversity decline in China and South-East Asia. But here we are again, 17 years later, with another novel zoonotic coronavirus, this time in Wuhan, China. Once again, initial human cases were linked to a market selling a variety of live animals. A constantly changing range of species have been selected as the culprits in the past few days, including bats and snakes, (the latter results were quickly refuted), and even crickets and wolf cubs. But, as yet, there is no scientific evidence that the virus has been isolated from any of these, although a recent report stated that \u201c15 environmental specimens collected in the western section (of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market) were positive for 2019-nCoV virus through testing and genetic sequencing analysis\u201d. The report continues: \u201cDespite extensive searching, no animal from the market has thus far been identified as a possible source of infection.\u201d It is not evident what \u201cenvironmental specimens\u201d refers to here and a complete list of those animals present in, or available from, the market would be appropriate to release together with details of which and how many of these have so far been tested. Wild rodents, which are often present in these markets, should also have been collected and tested as SARS-like coronaviruses have also been isolated from wild rats in China. But we may be chasing our tails, as animals testing positive may not be the source of the current outbreak. We need to step back and learn the broader lessons here. The perfect conditions for the emergence of human pandemics from previously unknown zoonotic pathogens has been created as a result of three things. First, the shift from subsistence hunting of wildlife to its sale into an international trade network largely driven by demand in China. Second, the extensive cross-exposure within this wildlife trade of species and species populations, which would not mix or be in contact in the wild. And, third, the exploitation of new source populations as areas become depleted of target species. It is also important to emphasise that these wild animals are typically now more expensive to buy (sometime a status symbol) than domestic livestock, so the demand that perpetuates wildlife trade in the region is a dietary choice and not driven by low income. The solution is collective action to remove the demand and also the supply chains to these wildlife markets and \u201cfarms\u201d (often laundering animals from the wild rather than breeding them). The call to close wildlife markets across China \u2013 which started following the SARS outbreak \u2013 has also been echoed by experts in China and in external organisations worldwide, such as the Wildlife Conservation Society. We have to hope that the Wuhan outbreak is a wake-up call for regulation of wildlife trade and animal health, action that is urgently needed to protect human health and the environment.

As the death toll from the Chinese epidemic jumped to 80 with those affected worldwide approaching 3,000, analysts said there were growing fears the crisis could become as bad as the SARS outbreak that hammered Asian markets in 2003. The outbreak of the coronavirus has led China to lock down the epicentre of the disease Wuhan - a city of 11 million people - while imposing tight travel restrictions on a number of other cities including Beijing. The move comes during the Chinese New Year holiday when hundreds of millions of people criss-cross the country and spend billions of dollars. The government decided late Sunday it would extend the holiday and related school closures beyond the original Jan 30 end date to \"reduce population flows\", state media said. The outbreak has led to the cancellation of Chinese New Year festivities, along with temporary closures of Beijing's Forbidden City, Shanghai's Disneyland and a section of the Great Wall. Stephen Innes at AxiCorp warned the economic shock to China and the world - just as a growth slowdown appeared to be easing - could be massive. \"The biggest threat to the global economy is not just because the disease spreads quickly across countries through networks related to global travel,\" he said in a note. \"But also because any economic shock to China's colossal industrial and consumption engines will spread rapidly to other countries through the increased trade and financial linkages associated with globalisation.\" He added: \"Unlike 2003 where SARS was less impactful on the developed world market, the rest of the world could feel the pinch this time around.\" If the new virus has the same impact on China as SARS, the falls could be worse then projected, Innes said, because consumption is a bigger part of the country's economy and its overall growth trajectory is weaker. Most regional markets were closed for the Chinese New Year break but Tokyo was open and fell 1.9 per cent by the break. Wellington, Manila and Jakarta also dropped. Both main oil contracts tumbled more than 2 per cent, having dropped more than 6 per cent last week owing to concerns about the effects on demand in the world's number two economy. The flight to safety saw the yen rally against the dollar, with the unit now up more than 1 per cent from eight-month lows touched earlier this year. Gold, another go-to asset in times of turmoil and uncertainty, is heading back towards US$1,600 and the six-year peaks touched at the start of January. While the main focus is on the spread of the virus, traders will also be keeping an eye on the release of earnings this week from top companies including Apple, Facebook and Samsung.","summary":"HONG KONG: Fears over the global economic impact of the deadly China virus sent oil prices plunging more than 2 per cent on Monday (Jan 27) to extend last week's sell-off, while safe-haven assets including the yen and gold rallied.

The task force is co-chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong. Among other measures, Mr Wong announced at a media conference that people should defer all non-essential travel to mainland China, an extension from an earlier advisory to defer all travel to Hubei. \"We are doing this now because of the latest developments in China which the China government itself has described as grave and they have also said the virus is getting stronger and infections will continue to rise,\" said Mr Wong. Given Singapore's status as an international transport hub, Mr Wong said this extended travel advisory is a necessary safeguard against further spread of the virus. Authorities will also strengthen border measures by implementing temperature screening for all incoming flights by Wednesday, Mr Wong said. Thermal scanners will be deployed at the piers of the airport to cover all incoming flights, he added. Currently, temperature screening is only conducted for passengers on flights from China at air checkpoints. Temperature screening will continue at land checkpoints for bus, car and train arrivals and at sea checkpoints. There will also be additional attention given to flights from mainland China at the aerobridge. These include visual identification of unwell travellers for evaluation by the medical team. Travellers deemed unwell with fever or respiratory symptoms, or have relevant travel history to Hubei, will be referred to nursing stations. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will also check passengers who are in possession of passports issued in Hubei. Such passengers will be referred for attention to ensure that they are well, and to obtain their contact details to expedite subsequent contact tracing if required. There will also be \"extra precautions\" taken for the workforce and students returning from mainland China, Mr Wong said. For students returning from China from Tuesday, they will be given a Leave of Absence (LOA) for 14 days so they can stay at home and minimise close contact with others. The minister said organisations have been advised to collect health and travel declarations from employees returning from mainland China from Tuesday. \"We are doing this now, we are getting ready now because we fully expect more to come back after the Chinese New Year holidays,\" he added. More stringent precautions are in place for organsiations with staff who have close contact and sustained interactions with vulnerable populations. These measures will apply to schools, including preschools, healthcare and eldercare facilities. Employers in these sectors will need to issue a Leave of Absence for 14 days upon their workers' return to Singapore. The general workforce is recommended to follow these measures as well. Employers may adopt additional precautionary measures if they choose to do so. Mr Wong said: \"We have no evidence that there is community spread of the virus in Singapore. But it may happen. And if it does we stand ready to take additional measures.\" \"I want to assure Singaporeans that we will do everything we can to protect Singaporeans and Singapore, but this does not mean overreacting or worse turning xenophobic. We must be proactive and rational in our response and base our actions on the available evidence and data,\" the minister added. The most important defence is still at the individual level. To beat the virus, it would not be enough for the Government to act alone, he said. Singapore has so far confirmed four cases of the SARS-like virus - the fourth was announced early Sunday morning. The first case of the novel coronavirus in Singapore was announced on Thursday, while two cases were confirmed on Friday. Contact tracing has been activated for confirmed cases and as a precautionary step, Government quarantine facilities have been set up to house close contacts who are well. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said there were no new confirmed cases of the Wuhan virus in Singapore as of noon on Sunday, adding that it has been notified of 92 suspected cases in total. Of the 92 suspected cases, 46 have tested negative for the new coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China. Test results for the remaining 42 cases are pending.

This applies to all students and staff of government schools, including MOE kindergartens, primary, secondary, special education schools, junior colleges and the Millenia Institute, who return from mainland China on Jan 15 or later. For polytechnics and Institutes of Technical Education (ITEs), which reopen a day earlier on Tuesday, the leave of absence for students and staff applies if they return from China on Jan 14 or later. The leave of absence will last for 14 days, starting from the day after their arrival in Singapore. This duration mirrors the incubation period of the coronavirus. Students on leave of absence will be supported through a home-based learning plan, MOE said. Schools will also start daily temperature taking exercises when they reopen after the Chinese New Year holidays on Wednesday. Students and staff will be monitored for any signs of flu-like symptoms. More than 800 students and several staff members who travelled to mainland China will have to take a leave of absence, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung at a press conference on Monday. Two individuals from government schools - one student and one staff member - visited Hubei province in the past 14 days, while 712 students and 62 staff members visited mainland China in the same period. From polytechnics and ITEs, three individuals visited Hubei province, while 107 students and six staff members visited mainland China. \"We do expect the numbers to go up as travel declarations come in,\" Mr Ong said, although he highlighted that the numbers were \"fairly manageable\" considering the number of schools in Singapore. Pre-school students and staff members returning from mainland China to Singapore from Jan 14 will have to take a two-week leave of absence as well. All pre-schools were notified in an advisory from the Early Childhood Development Agency on Monday morning, said Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee. Mr Lee also said that pre-school operators should provide paid leave of absence to affected employees, and monitor their health. About 500 to 600 pre-school teachers had gone to or returned from China for various reasons such as study trips and vacations, he said. Out of the 180,000 pre-school children in Singapore, he estimated that about 1,000 would have gone to or returned from China. \"We believe it's manageable. We are closely working with some 400 pre-school operators to make sure that this is smoothly managed,\" he said. \"ECDA as well as MSF (Ministry of Social and Family Development) colleagues will be visiting various pre-schools to check on implementation and provide support to the sector.\" Singapore's six autonomous universities have agreed to implement the same measures, said Mr Ong. \"Of course, there are also other private institutions,\" he said. \"For international schools, we will be contacting them and advising them to follow the same protocol.\" Mr Ong said schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have also ensured that there will be no organised trips to China until the end of March. \"Students who are already in China, the IHLs are in the process of recalling them.\" The new coronavirus, which originated in China\u2019s Wuhan, has so far killed 80 people and infected more than 2,700. A handful of cases have been reported outside China, including four in Singapore. MOE had earlier instituted a range of measures to protect schools against the virus, including requiring students and staff to declare their travel history and advising those who travelled to China to take their temperature regularly upon their return. \u201cThe latest LOA (leave of absence) measure allows MOE to better mitigate the potential risks posed by travel in our schools and institutions, while enabling them to continue with the usual learning and other activities,\u201d the ministry said. The ministry also advised students and their families to monitor their health and adopt good personal hygiene habits. \u201cParents should seek immediate medical attention for their children if unwell, and ensure that their children recover fully before they return to school for classes,\u201d it said. Mr Ong said the leave of absence advisory is different from a quarantine order as individuals are not legally required to comply. \"Having said that, (the government schools and IHLs) are all part of MOE,\" he said. \"So as an organisation, we will be able to enforce it.

The group has already announced an extension to the Lunar New Year holiday originally scheduled to end on Jan 30 \"to reduce population flows\". Transport curbs have also been imposed around China to cut off transmission routes. Wuhan is already under virtual lockdown and severe limits on movement are in place in several other Chinese cities.

That will include specific areas of the economy which will be impacted.\" Mr Wong said sectors like retail and tourism will feel a \"greater impact\" once travel restrictions \"start to bite\". \"So, we are monitoring these very carefully, working together with our economic agencies, and if need be, we will certainly respond, be it in the Budget, or as an off-Budget package,\" he added. \"We will make sure that we have resources available to help support our businesses, vulnerable groups as well as the economy.\" Singapore has so far confirmed four cases of the Wuhan coronavirus - the fourth was announced early Sunday morning.

Speaking at a multi-minister task force news conference on Monday (Jan 27), Mr Iswaran made this point by citing a case involving a post on HardwareZone Forum which was viewed by 4,600 unique visitors before it was eventually taken down. The post falsely claimed that someone in Singapore had died from the virus. The office overseeing the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) issued a general correction notice to SPH Magazines over the post. SPH Magazines, which operates HardwareZone Forum, complied with the correction notice in a post on Monday which included a link to the Factually article. SPH Magazines also said that HardwareZone.com had taken down the thread earlier, \"in line with its community guidelines\". For the facts of the case, the POFMA Office referred to a Factually article which said there have been no deaths among the confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus infection as of 11pm on Jan 26. Mr Iswaran said: \"Some who viewed the post would also have shared it with others and been misled by it. The Minister for Health had ascertained that there was a false statement of fact and was satisfied that it was in the public interest to issue a correction direction.\" \"We must take swift action against such falsehoods. Otherwise, there is a grave risk that they will spread and cause panic among our citizens.

He added that if any other cases come to the Government\u2019s attention, the same kind of evaluation would be applied and appropriate action taken. Mr Iswaran said the aim is to keep Singaporeans informed of the facts so that they can safely navigate the online terrain, discern truth from falsehood and know what they can do to lessen the risk to themselves and their family. He said his ministry is working closely with the Ministry of Health to regularly share important public information with citizens through multiple channels on social media and websites. \"The situation is fluid and we need the help and cooperation of the media, all Singaporeans and the residents in this critical national effort to prevent misinformation and falsehoods about the Wuhan coronavirus from sowing fear and causing panic in our society,\" he said.

The ban in Hong Kong includes those who have been in the province in the past 14 days but excludes Hong Kong citizens. So far, there are eight confirmed cases of the virus in the city. As fears about the virus outbreak intensify, calls have grown for Hong Kong's government to close the financial hub's border with mainland China to minimise the risk of infection.

Direct train and flight connections to and from Wuhan have been suspended. Health authorities on Sunday afternoon said 107 people were under quarantine, and there were 77 suspected cases.

At least 81 people have died since the new strain of coronavirus emerged in China's Wuhan, and millions are now under an effective quarantine, with all flights in and out of the city grounded and a ban on Chinese tour groups domestically and abroad. The measures come amid a boom in Chinese foreign travel, with the number of tourists from the country increasing nearly tenfold since 2003, according to a report by research firm Capital Economics. But businesses in destinations that rely on the huge numbers of Chinese tourists are already feeling the heat, with complaints of \"deserted\" beaches and shops, and concerns about the future. The outbreak carries echoes of the SARS crisis, which paralysed regional travel and battered local economies from late 2002. Chinese tourist numbers then fell by around a third. \"If they fell by a similar amount again, it would knock around 1.5-2.0 percentage points from (gross domestic product) in the most vulnerable countries,\" Capital Economics said. In Japan, the fall in Chinese visitors was already being felt in Asakusa, a popular tourist destination near the Sensoji temple. \"We've definitely been seeing less people this year,\" said Yoshie Yoneyama, 31, manager of a shop selling traditional Japanese sweets and a rice-based drink called amazake. \"I think there are less than half the numbers of last year or the year before,\" she told AFP. The number of Chinese holidaying in Japan has exploded from around 450,000 in 2003 to 8.4 million in 2018, accounting for 27 per cent of all inbound tourists as Tokyo works to expand the sector. But it will now be \"very difficult\" for Japan to achieve its target of 40 million tourists in 2020, Yuki Takashima, an economist at Nomura Securities, told AFP. And the effects will be felt beyond hotels, restaurants and tourist sites, because many Chinese tourists visit Japan specifically to shop. Electronic appliances and beauty products usually top of their lists, Takashima said, so retail outlets will see their bottom lines affected. The crisis has already sent Japan's key Nikkei index plunging, with stock in Shiseido - a cosmetics brand popular with Chinese tourists - plunging more than five percent on Monday. \"We can expect those stocks to continue to fall like dominoes,\" said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp. But he said Japan would be better placed to weather the storm than another top destination for Chinese tourists: Thailand. Tourism accounts for 18 per cent of the nation's GDP, with Chinese holidaymakers making up more than a quarter of total arrivals. The country's tourism minister has already warned a crisis on the scale of SARS could cost an estimated US$1.6 billion, and the effects are already clear in Phuket. \"For two days, the streets, the shops and the beaches have been deserted,\" said Claude de Crissey, who owns a 40-room hotel and a restaurant on the island. \"Phuket has focused almost exclusively on Chinese tourism ... if the situation continues, we will all be impacted,\" he told AFP. Australia too, already reeling from the effects of the bushfire crisis, is likely to feel the impact. Chinese visitor numbers doubled in the six years to June 2019, with mainlanders now accounting for 15 per cent of Australia's inbound tourists. Mario Hardy, CEO of the Pacific Asia Travel Association said it was hard to gauge how long the crisis would last. \"I would suspect the impact would be between three to six months, but it will really depend on how the situation evolves in the coming few weeks,\" he told AFP. In Japan, leather goods store owner Hayato Chiba said local businesses in the Ameyoko shopping district of Tokyo's Ueno were hoping for a swift resolution. \"An increasing number of shops in Ameyoko count on foreign customers, so it's getting a bit tough,\" said Chiba, 65, who represents around 400 local businesses. \"Something really serious is happening.

Alibaba said the measure applied across all its divisions, including to workers in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau as well as in mainland China. It employs more than 100,000 people worldwide, most of whom are in China. The Shanghai government also imposed a similar measure, announcing that all companies in the city would not be allowed to start work before Feb 9, as did the nearby city of Suzhou, home to a big industrial park for pharmaceutical firms and tech companies. The decision by the Shanghai government will affect companies such as Tesla Inc, General Motors and Volkswagen which either own factories or operate them in the city through ventures with local partners.

Staff who had not travelled could start working from the office from Feb 10, though that date could change, according to an internal note seen by Reuters. Bytedance declined to comment.

The virus spread through close contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. As for the Wuhan coronavirus, Mr Wong said: \"Some of you asked: What if there is a risk of infections spreading even before symptoms show. \"If that were to happen, I think the spread of the virus will be much faster because we are unable to identify and isolate unlike SARS - we had the means to because of symptoms.\" Nevertheless, Mr Wong said there is no conclusive evidence yet to prove that the Wuhan virus is capable of spreading pre-symptoms. \"We are in consultation with our medical experts on what the evidence for this is, because I think this is still quite preliminary,\" he said. \"It's certainly something we are watching out for, because if indeed this is happening, then certainly, we will have to do more and escalate our measures even further.\" Mr Wong said there are many \"imponderables\" and \"uncertainties\" regarding the Wuhan virus, adding that Singapore has to be prepared that things could worsen with more cases in China and abroad. \"And as I said, be psychologically prepared that this may take some time to unravel, but be assured too that you have a system in place,\" he stated. Mr Wong stressed that Singapore is better prepared to deal with an outbreak after learning lessons from the SARS episode. \"We have put in place inter-ministry coordination mechanisms. We have put in place drawer plans for a full range of different scenarios of the virus outbreak,\" he said. \"We want to assure Singaporeans that we are (better prepared), and that's why our message is: Keep calm, carry on with our lives, but all of us work together, take the necessary precautions and we can overcome this together.\" Authorities on Monday announced more stringent measures to combat the Wuhan virus, including expanded travel advisories for China, stepped-up checks at borders and compulsory leave of absences for some individuals returning from China. Ministry of Health director-designate of medical services Kenneth Mak said the measures are \"appropriate, ready and reasonable\" for the current situation. Mr Mak also said Singapore is collaborating with different healthcare stakeholders on improving its testing capabilities for the virus. \"(We are) seeing how we can use these capabilities to enhance our hospital and health services\u2019 ability to detect, screen and confirm the presence of such infections,\" he said. Minister Wong said the Government is prepared to \"marshal all available resources\" to fight the virus' spread. \"Our posture is to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can. But every action we take really has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,\" he said. \"I don't think we want to - on the basis of one or two reports, not even sure if it's conclusive - overreact and overdo things.

It is one of two makeshift hospitals that Chinese authorities are rushing to build within a fortnight in the city of 11 million people to relieve medical facilities swamped with patients waiting for hours to see doctors. Work to build Fire God Mountain started Friday and is due to be ready to receive patients on Feb 3, according to state media. The second one, named \"Thunder God Mountain\", will be ready for use on Feb 5. The construction workers all wore masks as mandated by the authorities for the entire population of the city, which has been under lockdown since Thursday. They are checked for fevers when they arrived by bus and again during their breaks. They worked around a forest of excavators and trucks bringing in prefab material at the site on the southwestern side of the city. \"We have to work fast to combat the epidemic,\" a worker in his 30s, who refused to give his name, told AFP. He said he worked nine hours per day, \"sometimes less, sometimes more. It depends on what they need\". The 25,000-square-metre hospital will have between 700 and 1,000 beds to treat patients of a pneumonia-like virus that has killed 81 people - mostly in Wuhan - and infected more than 2,700 across the country. The second facility will have 1,300 beds. \"We've mobilised all the workers left in Wuhan to work in shifts to ensure round-the-clock construction,\" Zhang Chongxi, general manager of the road and bridge company of Wuhan Construction, was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency. Chen Bingzhong, a former health ministry official, said the facilities are needed because infectious diseases should not be treated in general hospitals. \"Because the infectious power of this virus is too strong, it will infect other patients, including medical staff,\" Chen told AFP. China has experience building hospitals in record time in periods of crisis. In 2003, it built a facility in Beijing within a week to treat patients during the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic. Authorities have used this as a model for the new facilities for the patients ill with the novel virus, which shares genetic similarities with SARS. Premier Li Keqiang visited one of the construction sites on Monday during his first trip to Wuhan since the health crisis erupted - a sign of the growing concern among the leadership in Beijing. \"Fast doesn't mean without quality,\" Li, who wore a mask, told the workers, according to videos of his visit. \"Fire God Mountain\" is being erected next to a residential building. A road outside the construction site is used to park dozens of trucks and construction vehicles. The city's new rallying cry - \"Let's go Wuhan!\" - was written on a banner across the front of a truck. Bulldozers flattened the earth, electricians installed 5G antennas and workers began to bury pipes. \"We are happy to help in this situation.

Lately, he has had trouble finding basic supplies such as milk and eggs in the city of 11 million since it became the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak that has killed 81 and infected 2,740 people in China. \"There's a shortage. Everyone wants to stock up, but it is already too late,\" Badeephak told Reuters via Skype. \"There are no vehicles on the road except private vehicles, which I only see going to pharmacies and hospitals,\" he added. Badeephak wants to go home to Thailand, he has little choice but to wait. The Thai government has put a military plane on standby for a possible evacuation of its citizens, but Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Monday (Jan 27) they do not yet have Beijing's permission for the airlift. Most commercial flights out of Wuhan were halted last week to try to contain the virus. \"At the moment the Chinese authorities have said the situation is still under control, so we have prepared a plan ... Once it's time we will seek permission to fly in,\" Prayuth said. Thailand's Foreign Ministry says there are 64 Thais in Wuhan. Badeephak said the Thai Embassy told him there were 118 Thais in all of Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. The Thai government has faced criticism both at home and abroad over its handling of the illness, with many taking to social media to accuse the government of not doing enough. Thailand has reported eight cases of coronavirus, including seven Chinese tourists from Wuhan and a Thai woman who visited there. Prayuth said on Monday most Thais in Wuhan wanted to stay. But Badeephak said: \"I am pretty sure that more than 70-80 per cent (of Thais) ... want to go back home because everyone of us here knows that staying here is not safe.\" \"How I am doing right now is not good,\" he said. \"The town has become a ghost town.\"","summary":"BANGKOK: When Thai medical student Badeephak Kaosala dares to leave his rented apartment in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, he puts on a mask, gloves, a hat and layers of clothing to try to avoid infection with the coronavirus that has the city on lockdown.

The UN health body said in a situation report published late Sunday that the risk was \"very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level.\" In a footnote, the WHO said there had been an \"error\" in previous communications published on Thursday, Friday and Saturday which \"incorrectly\" said the global risk was \"moderate\". Asked for more detail, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said only that it was \"an error in the wording\". The WHO on Thursday stopped short of declaring the virus an international public health emergency - a rare designation used only for the most severe outbreaks that could trigger more concerted international action. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is visiting China this week to discuss further action to contain the virus, on Thursday said: \"This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency\". WHO's cautious approach can be seen in the context of past criticism over its slow or too hasty use of the term, first used for the deadly 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. During that outbreak, the UN health agency was criticised for sparking panic-buying of vaccines with its announcement that year that the outbreak had reached pandemic proportions, and then anger when it turned out the virus was not nearly as dangerous as first thought. But then in 2014, the WHO met harsh criticism for dragging its feet and downplaying the severity of the Ebola epidemic that ravaged three west Africa countries, claiming more than 11,300 lives by the time it ended in 2016.

The screening is also being implemented in anticipation of increase in travel volume leading up to the Chinese New Year holidays, according to an Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) news release on Friday morning. At Singapore's sea checkpoints, temperature screening also started at noon, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said in response to CNA's queries. Singapore confirmed its first case of the Wuhan virus on Thursday evening - a male Wuhan resident, 66, who arrived in Singapore with his family on Jan 20. He is currently in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and is in stable condition. Two more people were confirmed to have the virus on Friday afternoon, including the 37-year-old son of the first confirmed case. Singapore authorities had announced on Thursday that border screening would be expanded to all land and sea checkpoints, while a travel advisory has been expanded for Singaporeans to avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located. ICA and MPA on Friday said the temperature screening will be conducted by \"healthcare assistants\", and suspect cases will be referred to hospitals for further assessment. MPA said inbound travellers and ship crew will be screened at all sea checkpoints, including ferry and cruise terminals, PSA terminals and Jurong Port. China's National Health Commission confirmed 830 cases of patients have been infected as of Thursday, while the death toll from the virus has risen to 25. Elsewhere, the virus has infected at least one person in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and the US. Traffic is expected to be heavy between Saturday and Tuesday during the Chinese New Year holidays. \"Coupled with the implementation of temperature screening for travellers, delays are expected and travellers are advised to check traffic conditions before embarking on their journey,\" said ICA. \"We seek travellers\u2019 understanding and cooperation to work with our officers on site.\" Health advisories have been put up at the land and sea checkpoints to advise travellers on the precautions they are to take, especially when traveling to or arriving from China. \"Singapore residents who need to travel to the affected areas are advised to regularly check MOH\u2019s website for updates. \"Travellers to China are also advised to stay vigilant, monitor developments and heed the advice of the local Chinese authorities while in China,\" said ICA.","summary":"SINGAPORE: Temperature screening for travellers arriving at Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints began at noon on Friday (Jan 24), in response to cases of the novel coronavirus pneumonia that emerged in Wuhan, China and which has since spread to other countries.

SYDNEY: It is too early to make a definitive judgement about how Beijing has handled the outbreak of the potentially deadly coronavirus in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China. But it is already clear that any assessment will have to take into account not just the medical side of the virus\u2019s spread. Just as important in a public health crisis is how the authorities manage the disclosure of the information about the virus within the government, and to the public. So far, the handling of the crisis seems to have underlined one of the ongoing problems with the party-state, which places a premium on the control of information in the name of maintaining stability. In such a system, lower-level officials have no incentive to report problems until Beijing allows them to do so. Under the rule of Xi Jinping, such restrictions have only grown tighter. The difficulties of managing a public health crisis have been accentuated by this one\u2019s timing \u2013 on the eve of Lunar New Year, when literally millions of people would have been coming from Wuhan, a transport hub. Any official shutting down Wuhan would also have been shutting down the new year, a time when millions of Chinese get to reunite and celebrate as a family. Beijing has already had a test run in how not to handle a crisis of this kind, when the flu-like SARs (severe acute respiratory syndrome) began spreading in late 2002. China initially delayed responding to requests for more information from the World Health Organization when the virus first appeared in southern China in November 2002. It wasn\u2019t until February 2003 that Beijing told the WHO. As late as April, Beijing was still suppressing the numbers of people who were infected. It took a courageous doctor at the military hospital in Beijing, who informed the foreign media about the true count of patients, to force Beijing to deal with the issue openly. As a result, the epidemic took longer to control, it spread further, both in China and overseas, and more people died. There was one other lesson for the whistle-blowers. No one thanked them later. Just because they did good, they did not do well. Fast forward to 2020, and it is instructive to look at what has, and hasn\u2019t, changed. From all the reports coming out of China, albeit in a haphazard fashion, the medical and public health staff has performed with the skill that you would expect from highly skilled professionals. They isolated and identified the virus quickly. But from that point onwards, the early signs are that the SARS syndrome has been at play again. In early January, eight people in Wuhan were detained for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d about the virus. The official police report said they had been spreading \u201cfake news\u201d which had harmed social stability. Various officials in Wuhan continued to downplay the spread of the virus in the opening weeks of the year. As late as Tuesday evening, the Hubei provincial party secretary and governor hosted a lavish Lunar New Year event, despite reports that many of the performers were ill. But by then, the issue could no longer be contained. With infections and deaths rising, the authorities in Wuhan issued an order on Wednesday effectively quarantining the city, no small thing given its size and importance as a transport hub in central China. It is impossible to say, but at the moment, it certainly looks that way. Richard McGregor was the Financial Times bureau chief in Beijing and Shanghai between 2000 and 2009, and headed the Washington office after.

As many as 774 people died in the SARS epidemic, which reached nearly 30 countries. At the time, Beijing built the Xiaotangshan hospital in its northern suburbs in just a week. Within two months, it treated one-seventh of all the country's SARS patients, the Changjiang Daily said. \"It created a miracle in the history of medical science,\" the paper added. The Beijing hospital, built by 7,000 workers, was originally designed only to take people who were in recovery from SARS to relieve pressure on other hospitals.

Where masks were still available, at Chinatown Point for instance, long queues formed at stores. Customers were also seen snapping up hand sanitisers and thermometers. While some shops did not know when their next delivery would arrive, having sold out a fresh batch on Friday morning, others said that more deliveries were on the way. The Ministry of Health (MOH) however said in a press conference earlier in the week that there is \u201cmore than a sufficient\u201d number of N95 masks if there is a surge in demand. Typically there is an excess of six months of usage of \u201cvarious items\u201d including surgical masks during \"peace time\u201d, MOH said. \u201cThe public need not panic.

They include a stepped-up cleaning and disinfecting schedule and issuing travel and personal hygiene advisories to employees. Both ComfortDelGro and SMRT employees have been advised to avoid all travel to Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. SMRT also said that those returning from China will undergo mandatory temperature taking. \"As a precautionary measure for our commuters, hand sanitisers are available at all MRT stations and bus interchanges,\" added SMRT. FIRST IMPORTED CASEThe latest update comes after Singapore announced on Thursday its first confirmed case, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore from Guangzhou on Jan 20. He is in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and in a stable condition, authorities said. The man stayed at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa and indicated that he had kept within the hotel vicinity. Contact tracing for his close contacts is ongoing, said MOH, adding that it has identified 46 such people as of noon on Jan 23. One of them is his 37-year-old son, who is now confirmed as having the virus. Twenty-four of those close contacts - including his eight travelling companions - had left Singapore before his case was confirmed. The health authorities in the respective countries of those 24 people have been informed and are following up, said MOH, without providing information on the countries. The ministry has quarantined 16 people and is still trying to get in touch with the remaining five contacts, it said. \"The health status of all close contacts will be closely monitored. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient,\" said MOH. \"In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status,\" it added. There have been a total of 44 suspect cases in Singapore as of noon on Jan 24, of which 13 have tested negative and test results are pending for the remaining 28, said MOH. The suspect cases are aged between 1 and 78 years old. Two of the 44 suspect cases are employees of Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa, the hotel where the first confirmed case had stayed during his trip in Singapore, said Associate Professor Vernon Lee, director of communicable diseases at MOH. The two employees had no travel history to China, he added. There is still no evidence of community spread as the suspect cases were identified early, said Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services (designate) at MOH. Singapore has formed a multi-ministerial task force to deal with the situation and expanded border screening to all land and sea checkpoints. A travel advisory has also been expanded for Singaporeans to avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located. Schools in Singapore have asked parents to declare their travel plans for the Chinese New Year weekend. Meanwhile, Singapore Airlines' budget carrier Scoot has cancelled its daily flight to Wuhan as a precautionary measure. Singapore businesses with a presence in Wuhan have also taken measures. ST Engineering, which has rail projects in Wuhan, has stopped all business commutes there. MOH said on Friday that the government has sufficient stocks of masks in the warehouses and government stockpiles. It is also working with retailers to move available stocks to the retail shops, and stocks will be available progressively from Friday, it added. On Friday, China reported that the number of people infected by the SARS-like virus had exceeded 800, with 25 deaths. The markedly higher numbers were released just hours after the World Health Organization called the outbreak \"an emergency in China\", but stopped short of declaring the situation a global health emergency. China has effectively quarantined more than 20 million people across Wuhan and some nearby cities in response to the virus, and announced measures to curb its spread nationwide as hundreds of millions of people began travelling across the country this week for the Chinese New Year holiday. Streets and shopping centres in Wuhan, a major industrial and transport hub, are now eerily quiet after authorities told residents not to leave the city of 11 million, where most of the cases have been identified. The virus, which causes respiratory symptoms similar to a cold or flu, has been linked to a seafood market in Wuhan. That market has since been shut down. The virus has spread to Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, as well as provinces in northeastern, central and southern China. Across the world, confirmed cases have also been reported in Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.","summary":"SINGAPORE: Two more people have tested positive for the Wuhan virus in Singapore, bringing the total number of cases to three, the Ministry of Health announced on Friday (Jan 24).

Most of the cases were found in Wuhan city, where the virus is believed to have originated in a market which traded in illegal wildlife. With the number of confirmed cases rising by the hundreds every day, medical supplies in the city are in short supply as people flood into hospitals waiting to be treated. At least eight hospitals in Wuhan have issued public appeals for donations of goggles, masks, medical caps and protective suits for medical workers. Alumni networks of universities in Wuhan have also posted notes on social media calling for public support. Travel in and out of the city of 11 million people has been tightly controlled since Wednesday to keep the virus from spreading. The closure of manufacturers, suppliers and distributors of medical gear over the week-long Lunar New Year holiday starting this week is exacerbating the shortages.

What is key is determining the travel history of patients, given that symptoms of the Wuhan virus are similar to the flu, said Dr Lye Tong Fong, a general practitioner at Central 24-hr Clinic Group. \"The risk factors are basically their travel history and whether they are exposed to people also with these issues,\" he said. \"It's very hard to tell based on symptoms because the ... virus symptoms are almost like flu, there is no difference.

If the patient is deemed medically stable, they will be sent to the hospital by a dedicated ambulance service, said Dr Elly. Doctors have been instructed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to call for a Singapore Civil Defence Force ambulance, if the patient is deemed to be medically unstable. Patients aged 16 years and above whose conditions are medically stable will be sent to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital Emergency Department, while those below 16 years of age will be sent to KKH Children\u2019s Emergency Department. Such measures have already been put into place prior to the first confirmed case of the Wuhan virus, said doctors. \"Steps have already been circulated to all the GPs, so we all know what to do,\" said Dr Elly. According to a Jan 23 MOH circular to GPs seen by CNA, a suspect case is defined as \"a person with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of pneumonia or severe respiratory infection with breathlessness and travel to mainland China within 14 days before onset of illness\". It also refers to \"a person with an acute respiratory illness of any degree of severity who, within 14 days before onset of illness, had been to a hospital in mainland China or had close contact with a case of 2019 novel coronavirus infection\".

He reported having a sore throat while on the flight but no fever. The man developed a fever the next day and began coughing. When he went to SGH on Wednesday, he was immediately isolated, diagnosed with pneumonia and identified to MOH as a suspect case at 10pm. He tested positive for the new coronavirus at 6pm on Thursday. The man is currently in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and is in stable condition. On Friday afternoon, the ministry announced two more confirmed cases.

This includes wearing masks when unwell and practising proper hand washing, they told CNA. As of Friday, the number of suspected cases had climbed to 44, with patients aged between one to 78, according to the Health Ministry. At least 25 deaths had been reported in China as of Friday, with more than 830 confirmed cases of the virus. Cases have also been confirmed in Japan, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the United States. Below are some guidelines on how to respond to the Wuhan virus situation in Singapore, according to medical professionals. 1. DON'T PANIC Members of the public should stay calm, said infectious diseases expert Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang. \u201cBecause the Wuhan coronavirus is currently not spreading in Singapore, people should not panic and overreact,\u201d said Assoc Prof Hsu, who is programme leader of infectious diseases and co-director of global health at the National University of Singapore\u2019s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. \u201cThere is no need to stockpile masks, for example. The Ministry of Health, which has learned critical lessons from the various outbreaks that afflicted Singapore including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), will issue appropriate guidance and information in a timely manner,\u201d he added. Instead, people should keep abreast of the situation, put on masks when they feel unwell, wash their hands properly and avoid travel to Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the crisis. 2. WEAR A SURGICAL MASK Infectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam urged people to use a surgical mask instead of an N95 mask. \u201cA surgical mask works both ways. It can prevent transmission from others to you and from you to others,\u201d he said. When worn, the mask should cover the nose and mouth and rest on the chin, he added. It is important for the mask to fit well, he said. The mask can be used until it is wet inside. Once wet, it should be replaced with a new one. This means that a dry mask can be used again, Dr Leong said. He advised users to keep it in a bag without deforming it. He cautioned that drying a mask in the open could allow the germs to spread in the air. Wearing an N95 mask could be counter-productive as users might touch their faces more often from discomfort, spreading viruses on their hands, he said. 3. WASH HANDS THOROUGHLY Head of primary care at Healthway Medical Dr John Cheng said the use of anti-bacterial and alcohol-based soaps is recommended. \u201cThis is especially when coming into contact with common exchanged items such as money and utensils, and items such as handrails and lift buttons,\u201d he said. Using hand sanitisers is as effective, he added. According to Singapore\u2019s HealthHub, proper hand washing means washing hands for at least 30 seconds with soap and water. \u201cThe constant rubbing action helps soap break down the grease and dirt that carry most germs. This way, your hands don\u2019t just smell fresh, but you\u2019ll also reduce the germ count on your hands by up to 99 per cent,\u201d according to the website. The recommended eight-step hand-washing routine includes cleaning between fingers, the base of thumbs and fingernails. If there is no soap available, Dr Leong said that water alone could be effective as it can also break down viruses. 4. VACCINATIONS While there is no vaccination available for the Wuhan virus, Dr Leong said that the general public being vaccinated against influenza will reduce the risk of them from falling sick. This will reduce the burden on the healthcare system and prevent distraction from people who need attention more urgently, he added. Dr Cheng said that aside from the influenza vaccine to protect an individual against influenza-based infections, it is also important to have all other vaccinations up-to-date to safeguard your general health and immunity. These include vaccines for hepatitis A, B, typhoid, region-specific vaccines and pneumonia vaccines. \u201cThis is important especially for the elderly and immunocompromised patients,\u201d he said.

Instead, people should keep abreast of the situation, put on masks when they feel unwell, wash their hands properly and avoid travel to Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the crisis. 2. WEAR A SURGICAL MASK Infectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam urged people to use a surgical mask instead of an N95 mask. This means that a dry mask can be used again, Dr Leong said. Wearing an N95 mask could be counter-productive as users might touch their faces more often from discomfort, spreading viruses on their hands, he said. 3. WASH HANDS THOROUGHLY Head of primary care at Healthway Medical Dr John Cheng said the use of anti-bacterial and alcohol-based soaps is recommended. If there is no soap available, Dr Leong said that water alone could be effective as it can also break down viruses. 4. VACCINATIONS While there is no vaccination available for the Wuhan virus, Dr Leong said that the general public being vaccinated against influenza will reduce the risk of them from falling sick.","datetime":1579888740000,"date_time":1580045978000},{"title":"Wuhan virus: 8 Chinese nationals who were in \u2018close contact\u2019 with Singapore\u2019s first case quarantined in JB hotel","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/asia\/wuhan-virus-8-chinese-nationals-singapore-johor-bahru-malaysia-12325404","article":"KUALA LUMPUR: Eight Chinese nationals who were in \u201cclose contact\u201d with the first person to test positive for the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore have entered Malaysia and are now being quarantined in a hotel in Johor Bahru, Malaysia\u2019s Deputy Health Minister Lee Boon Chye confirmed on Friday (Jan 24). \u201cThey are now in a hotel in Johor Bahru,\u201d he told CNA in a phone interview.

Temperature scanners have been set up at the entrance of the customs area. Travellers taking the bus only have to walk past these machines as they head to the immigration counters. Mr Zheng Pei Nan, 75, was travelling from Malaysia with his family. He told CNA he was not bothered by the scanners, part of the Mass Fever Screening System. \"It wasn't inconvenient to pass the scanners after alighting from the bus,\" he said in Mandarin, adding that the family only comes to Singapore once a year. He told CNA that he was aware of the virus but was not worried because he rarely travels to faraway countries. Mr Li Jian, a tourist from Changsha, Hunan Province in China, said he did not notice the scanners at first, but lauded them as a good idea. \"It's important to protect yourself and take your own measures,\" he said. The 50-year-old, who will be travelling around Singapore and Malaysia for six days, said he was not worried about catching the virus in Singapore. \"Singapore is a developed country,\" he said. According to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, screening measures for visitors arriving by car will ready by Friday night. Those for motorcycles, lorries and trains will be rolled out progressively, said Superintendent Joe Tan, who is deputy commander of ground operations at Tuas Checkpoint. Visitors arriving by car will have to roll down their windows to allow healthcare assistants to use Forward-Looking Infra-red Radar thermometers to check their temperature, he said. Those who have a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius and above will be taken to a holding area, where a nurse will interview them about their travel history and who they have been in contact with. Depending on the patient\u2019s answers, a doctor may carry out further checks to determine whether he or she is a suspected case and should be taken to the hospital. While waiting for the ambulance, the individual will be isolated and quarantined in another room. If the individual arrived by car, their vehicle and travel partners will also be moved to a holding area and further assessment will be carried out, said Superintendent Tan. As for affected individuals who arrive by bus, the people travelling with the suspected case are not treated as contact cases until the case is confirmed, said Associate Professor Vernon Lee, director of communicable diseases at the Ministry of Health. \u201cWe will only initiate the contact tracing proper, to label someone as a close contact, if the initial suspect case turns positive and it then becomes a confirmed case,\u201d he said. \u201cFor suspect cases they are still (treated as) suspect. There are quite a number of suspect cases and we don't perform aural (ie phone) contact tracing or any other measures on individuals travelling with the suspect cases.\u201d According to an ICA news release on Friday morning, the screening was implemented in anticipation of increased travel volume leading up to the Chinese New Year holidays. Due to the festive period, travel volume is expected to increase and there will naturally be delays, said ICA. During the year-end festive period in 2019, Tuas and Woodlands Checkpoints collectively saw about 475,000 visitors per day. While there will be minimal delays for those who arrive by bus because visitors can just walk by the temperature scanners, visitors arriving by car can expect delays because of the additional measures, said Superintendent Tan. The delay will depend on how many individuals there are in the car. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to seek citizens\u2019 understanding that there will be delays because it is an additional check that has been put in place,\u201d he added. Temperature screening also started at noon at Singapore\u2019s sea checkpoints, said the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) in response to CNA queries. Singapore authorities had announced on Thursday that border screening would be expanded to all land and sea checkpoints, while a travel advisory has been expanded for Singaporeans to avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located. Health advisories have also been put up at the land and sea checkpoints to advise travellers on the precautions they are to take, especially when traveling to or arriving from China. Singapore confirmed its first case of the Wuhan virus on Thursday evening - a male Wuhan resident, 66, who arrived in Singapore with his family on Jan 20. He is currently in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and is in stable condition. Two more people were confirmed to have the virus on Friday afternoon, including the 37-year-old son of the first confirmed case.

The pathogen appears to be a new strain of coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause diseases such as the common cold and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds in mainland China and Hong Kong between 2002 and 2003. It has been named \"2019-nCoV\". Arnaud Fontanet, head of the department of epidemiology at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, told AFP that the new strain was 80 per cent genetically identical to SARS. The symptoms caused by the new virus appears to be less aggressive as compared to SARS, according to an AFP report. These include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. However, its milder nature can also cause alarm as it allows more people to travel further before symptoms can be detected, the director of the Institute of Global Health Antoine Flahault said. The virus was first detected at a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has been shut down by authorities following the outbreak. The market offered exotic wildlife for sale, including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game, AFP reported. Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined. Two studies from China indicated that bats are the likely origin, as the strain was found to be closely related to a strain that exists in the animal. \"Bats being the native host of the Wuhan CoV (coronavirus) would be the logical and convenient reasoning, though it remains likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans,\" the researchers from several institutions in China wrote in a paper. Another study identified snakes as a possible intermediate host. Animals have been determined as the source of the virus, but human-to-human transmission of the virus is \"affirmative\", top Chinese expert on infectious diseases Zhong Nanshan told state broadcaster CCTV. It has since been passed to people who have had no contact with the market where the virus first broke out. Doctor Nathalie MacDermott of King's College London told AFP that it seems likely that the virus is spread through droplets in the air from sneezing or coughing. There is currently no vaccine for the virus. Members of the public have been advised to take steps to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes wearing masks when experiencing respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing, and observe good hygiene practices, like washing their hands frequently. They should also avoid places and close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness. Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Health has issued an advisory asking travellers to avoid contact with live animals and consuming raw and undercooked meat. Those who are feeling unwell should also seek prompt medical attention, it added. More than 800 people have been infected with the coronavirus in China, with at least 26 fatalities reported. Most of the patients came from Wuhan, where the virus started. It has since spread to other major cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Transport in and out of Wuhan have ceased operations in an effort to prevent and control the spread of the virus. Authorities have also locked down several cities in Hubei province as a response to the outbreak. Entertainment venues such as Shanghai\u2019s Disneyland park, theatres and karaoke bars have also been closed down. Hubei province authorities also said they were calling off cultural performances and public cultural venues. Travel agencies in the province have suspended business and the government has announced that refunds would be given to those who cancel transport tickets. Beijing has also cancelled Chinese New Year holiday gatherings at temples. The first case of the virus reported outside of China was on Jan 13, when a Chinese woman was diagnosed with mild pneumonia after returning to Thailand from Wuhan. Another case was confirmed in Japan the next day. So far, there have been confirmed cases in nine countries outside of China. Thailand has the most reported cases, at four. Singapore reported its first case on Jan 23 \u2013 a 66-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on Jan 20 and stayed at Shangri-La\u2019s Rasa Sentosa Resort. He reported symptoms such as a sore throat and fever and went to Singapore General Hospital, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and identified as a suspect case. He was confirmed to have been infected by the virus on Jan 23. Contact tracing has been initiated to identify people who may have had close contact with the man. Two other cases have since been confirmed, one of which is the man\u2019s 37-year-old son. Border screening has been implemented in several countries, including Singapore, as a response to the outbreak. Budget carrier Scoot has cancelled its daily flight to Wuhan and schools across the island have asked parents to declare their travel plans for the Chinese New Year weekend.","summary":"SINGAPORE: A new strain of coronavirus has infected hundreds of people in China and overseas, killing more than 20 people since it was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan earlier this month.

The contagion has so far claimed 26 lives in China, sickened hundreds and has spread across several Asian countries as well as the US. \"I'm pleased to report she is clinically doing well and is in stable condition,\" said Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health of the new patient. Nancy Messonier, senior official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the agency had so far tested 63 samples from patients across 22 US states for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Eleven were found to be negative and two positive, and the CDC was working to make diagnosis kits more nationally available. At present the testing is occurring at the agency's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. The Chicago patient had travelled to Wuhan in late December before returning to the US on Jan 13, Arwady said, a few days before health screenings began at major airports for travellers originating from the central Chinese city that is at the centre of the outbreak. She began experiencing symptoms and called her health care providers, and was later admitted to hospital and placed in isolation. \"She has not taken public transportation, have not attended any large gatherings and, she has not had extended close contact with anyone outside her home since returning from China,\" added Arwady.

Few flights were available to the city. \"This year we have a very scary Chinese New Year.

He said a prolonged shutdown should not pose food-shortage problems because many Chinese had stocked up for the holiday. Besides Wuhan, 12 smaller cities nearby have battened down the hatches, with most announcing measures Friday that include closing public venues, restricting large gatherings and halting public transportation, as well as urging citizens not to travel.

In Beijing, staff in full-body protective suits were seen Friday checking the temperatures of people entering a subway station. Thermal cameras also scanned passengers arriving at Beijing's West Railway Station. Beijing has been praised for its response in contrast to SARS, when it took months to report the disease and initially denied WHO experts any access. Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, asked China's people to forego New Year gatherings this year and confine themselves at home until the all-clear.

SEOUL: The website of South Korea\u2019s public health authority currently features an image of a smartly dressed woman and man wearing masks while posing in front of a mishmash of signboards written in Chinese characters. In depicting two people who are remaining calm while exercising caution as a new coronavirus afflicts the country and businesses and families brace for disruption, the government appears to be telling its people: Do not panic but do wear a mask. Next to the photo is a message imploring all South Koreans to take part in efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus, a mysterious new illness in the country. While the government is calling on the country as a whole to work to keep South Korea safe, this latest health scare underscores the reality that in this country, it is still the government that is responsible for management during challenging times. South Korea this week reported two cases of the new coronavirus that appears to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has also been reported in Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Japan. The number of cases in China grew to more than 800 this week, raising fears of a global pandemic, with even the US reporting a case. In an unfortunate bit of timing, while South Koreans are fretting over the disease this week, the country announced its weakest economic growth since the global financial crisis of a decade ago. Of late, South Korea\u2019s export-dependent economy has dealt with tremors from the trade conflict between the United States and China, as well as the country\u2019s own spat with Japan. In announcing the weak growth figures, a central bank official highlighted how the new coronavirus could pose a risk to consumption as happened in 2015 when there was an outbreak of the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in the country. South Korea\u2019s economy ought to be less vulnerable than ever to a public health crisis, as there are now ways for businesses to maintain operations with workers not being in the same physical space. This is a country with some of the most widely available Wi-Fi connection anywhere in the world, meaning that it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for workers to be just as productive from home. But despite having the technological infrastructure, South Korea has generally been slow to adapt to workplace evolutions like remote working. The country\u2019s traditions of collectivism still posit that all members of a team should, whenever possible, be together in the office for the whole day. Someone who suggests that they would prefer to spend the day at home by themselves than in the office with the team might be seen as selfish or anti-social. Beyond trust or perception issues, there is a deeper problem of a risk-averse culture in South Korea that deters employers from taking such bold moves. If South Korea seems risk averse, part of this may be explained by the country\u2019s national psyche. Having fought a destructive civil war in the early 1950s, many Koreans were left feeling that the country got a late start and had to work harder than others to develop. Having built a successful economy, Korean policymakers sometimes fear potential blowback from risky moves. That thinking is also extended to organisational cultures, where newer additions such as flexible work arrangements and remote working are deemed contrarian to and may dilute the ethos of a strong work ethic built into the national psyche. I remember years ago one successful Korean businessman telling me over dinner, \u201cYou in the West had a head start on us. We lost our country once. We cannot lose it again.\u201d That risk averse mind-set also extends to the government, which has been facing criticism for stifling innovation. A telling example is the case of Tada, a ride-sharing service. The country\u2019s large and vocal taxi lobby successfully pushed the government to enact legislation that would ban Tada from operating, arguing that the company could push traditional taxis out of business. To many, the case of Tada sent the message that the Korean government is more interested in protecting vested interests than in promoting innovation. This week, in a case local media dubbed \u201crevenge of the nerds,\u201d a group of tech entrepreneurs launched a political movement with the hope of pushing through regulatory reform that would create conditions for innovation. The founders describe being frustrated at the government who promise to ease red tape, then fail to follow through. According to one founder, South Korea has missed out on chances in cloud, big data, drones, autonomous driving, blockchain and sharing-economy technology because of the regulations. That perception of an indecisive government was also reienforced during the last epidemic outbreak in South Korea \u2013 MERS in 2015. Many here are making comparisons with that episode to question if things will be managed better this time around. The South Korean public was critical of the government in 2015 for bungling its response to the outbreak by failing to properly implement quarantine measures and not sharing information transparently with the public. Still, even though 36 people died out of 186 reported cases, MERS never snowballed into the full-blown pandemic many feared, but the uncertainty surrounding the ailment took a toll on South Korea\u2019s economy, leading to steep drops in travel and many forms of consumer spending. This time around, the country\u2019s public health authorities appear to be more decisive in taking steps to manage the risk of contagion. Airports and seaports have announced stepped-up screening measures, with separate procedures for flights from Wuhan. But that boldness and decisiveness from the government must extend wider. In times of crisis in South Korea, it is the government that is expected to lead. South Koreans look to official institutions for guidelines, and if things don\u2019t go well, it\u2019s the government that gets the blame. Similarly, businesses and organisations will also be looking to signals from the government in implementing working arrangements to contain the risks to the workforce and the economy. Ironically, the outbreak of this virus may provide the government with an opportunity to ease flexible working arrangements into the workplace culture in South Korea. That may not be a bad thing in taking a step towards a more innovative and risk-taking culture overall. More pressingly, if the South Korean government is serious about not letting the Wuhan virus take a significant hit on its economy, then implementing business continuity processes is a crucial step that has to come sooner rather than later. During MERS in 2015, the slow response and lack of transparency by the government saw measures to contain the virus such as school closures and making public the list of hospitals affected with cases carried out almost a month after the first case in May. Even then, without any clear signal from the government and lax isolation or quarantine measures, few companies implemented business continuity processes to isolate their staff from the risks. In the coming days, we will find out how much the South Korean government has learned from the experience with MERS. Yesterday, my phone buzzed with an urgent message from the government, the kind of text they send out when monsoon rains create risk of flood, or when air pollution rises to dangerous levels, imploring everyone to wash their hands, cover their mouths when coughing, and yes, wear a mask. I hope to receive another such government alert soon that advises employers to take the necessary steps to protect their business processes, including allowing their staff to work from home.

The South Korean public was critical of the government in 2015 for bungling its response to the outbreak by failing to properly implement quarantine measures and not sharing information transparently with the public. This time around, the country\u2019s public health authorities appear to be more decisive in taking steps to manage the risk of contagion. Similarly, businesses and organisations will also be looking to signals from the government in implementing working arrangements to contain the risks to the workforce and the economy. Ironically, the outbreak of this virus may provide the government with an opportunity to ease flexible working arrangements into the workplace culture in South Korea. More pressingly, if the South Korean government is serious about not letting the Wuhan virus take a significant hit on its economy, then implementing business continuity processes is a crucial step that has to come sooner rather than later. During MERS in 2015, the slow response and lack of transparency by the government saw measures to contain the virus such as school closures and making public the list of hospitals affected with cases carried out almost a month after the first case in May. Even then, without any clear signal from the government and lax isolation or quarantine measures, few companies implemented business continuity processes to isolate their staff from the risks.","datetime":1579950180000,"date_time":1580046053000},{"title":"Wuhan virus: Malaysia confirms first 3 cases; all patients related to Chinese national who was Singapore's first case","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/asia\/wuhan-virus-malaysia-confirms-first-3-cases-all-patients-related-12331172","article":"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia on Saturday (Jan 25) said it had confirmed three cases of coronavirus infection, the first in the Southeast Asian country. Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said the three individuals infected were related to the 66-year-old man that was confirmed by Singaporean health authorities to have tested positive for the virus. On Friday, Malaysia\u2019s Deputy Health Minister Lee Boon Chye said eight Chinese nationals who were in close contact with the first person to test positive for the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore had entered Malaysia and were being quarantined in a hotel in Johor Bahru. The three infected patients are now being monitored at the Sungai Buloh hospital in Kuala Lumpur. \u201cThe three here are the wife, 65, and two grandchildren (ages 2 and 11) of the man tested positive in Singapore,\u201d said Dr Dzulkefly.

The newly identified coronavirus can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. It is still too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. On Saturday, authorities in China announced the number of cases had surged to nearly 1,300 - the majority of which were in Hubei. Health officials in the province also revealed that 15 new deaths took place in Wuhan, bringing the total number of fatalities to 41 since the outbreak began. The disease has spread to 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Wuhan and 13 other cities in Hubei have been locked down in an unprecedented quarantine effort aimed at containing the deadly respiratory contagion, which has spread to several other countries.","summary":"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia on Saturday (Jan 25) said it had confirmed three cases of coronavirus infection, the first in the Southeast Asian country.

The country's most important celebration has been all but cancelled for some 56 million people as authorities expanded travel bans in central Hubei province, now affecting 18 cities. On Saturday, when they should have been celebrating, citizens of Wuhan stood in line at a pharmacy to buy masks from employees in full-body protective suits and surgical gloves. On the eastern outskirts of Wuhan - Hubei's capital and the source of the previously unknown 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) - police manning a roadblock turned away a handful of vehicles trying to exit the city. \"Nobody can leave,\" an officer told AFP. But the police allowed some medical workers who had gone home for the holidays to re-enter the city to help at overwhelmed hospitals. \"They need us to go there, otherwise they will be too exhausted,\" said one of the women, pulling a suitcase. But the respiratory contagion continues to spread. The nationwide death toll has jumped to 41, the government said Saturday, after 15 more people died in Wuhan. Confirmed infections also surged to 1,287, up from 830 reported 24 hours earlier. Most of the deaths and overall cases have been in Hubei. In a dramatic escalation of the central government's involvement, China deployed 450 military medical staff to Wuhan, state media said. The medics, who arrived on military aircraft late Friday, include doctors with experience combating SARS or Ebola and will be dispatched to hospitals that are reportedly short on beds due to a crush of infected patients and worried locals. The National Health Commission also ordered nationwide measures to detect people carrying the virus on planes, trains and buses across the country. \"Everyone is just trying to protect themselves,\" said a man in a surgical mask at a Wuhan pharmacy where customers were stocking up on masks, gloves and disinfectant. But the man, who declined to give his name, expressed confidence in Chinese authorities. \"The government is handling this. It's not a problem.\" The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003 and spread to a number of other countries. It has now spread nationwide and to a dozen other countries, with France saying three cases had been confirmed there - the first known European infections. Australia and Malaysia on Saturday became the latest countries to confirm infections. Beijing's Forbidden City, Shanghai Disneyland, and a section of the Great Wall are among many attractions that have closed as a precaution. The New Year is usually a joyous occasion for family reunions, but not for many in Wuhan. \"Usually we celebrate as a family. Now, because of the virus I'm not even visiting my parents,\" said Wang Fang, a 49-year-old Wuhan native. \"It'll be great just to be able to make it through (the outbreak).\" China's aggressive response has won praise, especially compared to its handling of SARS, when it was accused of reacting sluggishly and stonewalling the international community. \"China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,\" US President Donald Trump tweeted, hours after the United States confirmed its second case. \"The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency,\" he added. \"It will all work out well.\" China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! The virus emerged at a bad time for containment, with hundreds of millions of Chinese rushing home for the holiday. The timing could limit the economic impact, however, since much of China normally shuts down anyway during the roughly week-long break. The outbreak emerged in late December, traced to a Wuhan seafood and live animal market that sold a vast range of exotic animals and other bushmeat. The World Health Organization on Thursday stopped short of declaring a global emergency, which would have prompted greater international cooperation, including possible trade and travel restrictions. Wuhan resembles a ghost town due to the clampdown, but hospitals bustled with worried patients being screened by staff wearing full-body protective suits. The city's Guiyuan Temple is normally thronged for the Lunar New Year with tens of thousands of devotees paying respects to a deity associated with wealth. But police manning a roadblock on Saturday turned away AFP journalists, saying the temple was closed to prevent the virus's spread.

The announcement came as city leader Carrie Lam faced criticism in some quarters over her administration's response to the crisis. Of the five people who have tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong so far, four arrived via a newly built high-speed train terminal which connects with the mainland. That led to calls from some medical experts and politicians to limit, or even halt, arrivals from China, the epicentre of the outbreak with 41 people dead. Lam held emergency meetings with health officials on Saturday morning after returning from Davos. \"Today I declare the lifting of the response level to emergency,\" she told reporters. Schools and universities, which are currently on a Lunar New Year break, would remain closed until Feb 17, Lam said. All mainland arrivals to Hong Kong will now need to sign health declaration forms, she added, while public events including a new year gala and next month's marathon, would also be called off. \"We haven't seen serious and widespread infections (in Hong Kong), but we are taking this seriously and we hope to be ahead of the epidemic,\" Lam said. Hong Kong has a recent experience of deadly viral outbreaks. Nearly 300 people were killed by SARS in 2003, a tragedy that left a profound psychological impact on one of the most densely populated places on earth. The city's ability to combat the crisis was hampered by moves in mainland China to cover up and play down the outbreak, leaving a lasting legacy of distrust among many Hong Kongers. Animosity towards the mainland has intensified in recent years as Beijing tightens political control over the semi-autonomous territory. The outbreak also comes at a sensitive time for Lam, who currently boasts record low approval ratings after seven months of pro-democracy protests. \"We must stand united so that we can prevent and control the disease,\" she said, in a nod to the political unrest. The often violent protests have battered Hong Kong's reputation for stability and helped tip it into recession, with the recent virus outbreak compounding the city's economic woes. Hospitals are already struggling with the winter flu season, but officials are isolating anyone with a history of travel to central China and those exhibiting respiratory tract infections that look similar to the virus. So far some 300 people have been tested and monitored for the virus. Quarantine centres have been set up in remote holiday parks for anyone found to have come into close contact with people who tested positive. On Saturday, officials announced a newly built but still-empty public housing block would be used for medical staff on the frontline who did not want to risk returning to their families.","summary":"HONG KONG: Hong Kong on Saturday (Jan 25) declared the outbreak of a mystery virus as an \"emergency\" - the city's highest warning tier - as authorities ramped up measures aimed at reducing the risk of further infections spreading.

An empty bus was allowed to pass the roadblock into Wuhan after showing documentation to the police at the roadblock. Three young nurses who crossed the barrier on foot told AFP they were going to two hospitals. Two of them were waiting for a friend to pick them up. \"We went to our hometowns for holidays before the ban on transportation, but because of the epidemic we have to come back quickly to Wuhan,\" said one. Dragging wheelie cases behind them, they were holding their coat hoods up against the rain. \"They need us to go there, otherwise they will be too exhausted,\" another medical worker who didn't want to be named told AFP. In the city centre, temples were closed and holiday festivities cancelled, but people gathered instead in pharmacies to buy medical supplies. At one store, customers queued at the cash register while staff in protective gear retrieved what they needed and brought it out to them. Pharmacy staff were in full body suits and gloves, wearing two sets of face masks. People rifled through boxes of face masks, comparing different makes and models. Full body suits had already sold out. Amid fears of rising prices and lack of products, some sales were being restricted and officials were regulating sales. \"My duty is to supervise the price of what pharmacists are selling,\" said Li Xiang, a market supervisor at one pharmacy. \"Goods must be from official channels and prices shall not be hiked.\" Li told AFP that the government was making an effort to \"maintain social stability and safeguard people's lives.\" A popular traditional Chinese medicine for treating fevers was being restricted to only two boxes per person to manage high demand. A local radio station played in the pharmacy ran an advert reminding people to wear a mask. \"Everyone is just trying to protect themselves,\" said one man in a surgical mask who declined to give his name. \"The government is in control of this. It's not a problem,\" he added. Meanwhile, in a taxi, a rap song playing on the radio echoed the patriotic fervour, telling people not to be afraid of the virus. \"Wuhan people are strong enough to fight and defeat it,\" the rapper chanted.","summary":"WUHAN: Police at a roadblock on the outskirts of Wuhan turned away cars trying to leave the virus-stricken city on Saturday (Jan 25), as other anxious residents trapped inside spent the Chinese New Year stocking up on masks and medical supplies.

China also announced further transport restrictions. With more than 1,400 people infected worldwide, most of them in China, Hong Kong declared a virus emergency, scrapped celebrations and restricted links to mainland China. Australia confirmed its first four cases on Saturday, Malaysia confirmed four and France reported Europe's first cases on Friday, as health authorities around the world scrambled to prevent a pandemic. The United States is arranging a charter flight on Sunday to bring its citizens and diplomats back from Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the epicentre of the outbreak, the Wall Street Journal reported. In Hong Kong, with five confirmed cases, the city's leader Carrie Lam said flights and high speed rail trips between the city and Wuhan will be halted. Schools in Hong Kong that are currently on Chinese New Year holidays will remain closed until Feb. 17. Xi held a politburo meeting on Saturday on measures to fight the \"accelerating\" outbreak, state television reported. As of 8pm local time on Saturday, the death toll in China had risen to 42, authorities reported. Some 1,372 people in China had been infected with the virus - traced to a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. The virus has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, and the United States. In Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, officials appealed for masks and protective suits. \"We are steadily pushing forward the disease control and prevention ... But right now we are facing an extremely severe public health crisis,\" Hu Yinghai, deputy director-general of the Civil Affairs Department, told a news briefing. The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. Ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing said it was halting inter-city services to and from Beijing from Sunday, while the capital will also stop running inter-province shuttle buses. State broadcaster CCTV, citing an announcement from China's tourism industry association, said the country would halt all group tours, both at home and abroad, from Monday. Wuhan said it would ban non-essential vehicles from its downtown starting Sunday, further paralysing a city of 11 million that has been on virtual lockdown since Thursday, with nearly all flights cancelled and checkpoints blocking the main roads leading out of town. Authorities have since imposed transport restrictions on nearly all of Hubei province, which has a population of 59 million. Australia confirmed its first four cases in two different cities on Saturday, and the country's chief health official said he expected more cases as Australia is a popular destination for Chinese tourists. State-run China Global Television Network reported on Saturday that a doctor who had been treating patients in Wuhan, 62-year-old Liang Wudong, had died from the virus. US coffee chain Starbucks said it was closing all its outlets in Hubei province for the week-long Chinese New Year holiday, following a similar move by McDonald's in five Hubei cities. Workers in white protective suits checked temperatures of passengers entering the subway at Beijing's central railway station on Saturday, while some train services in the eastern Yangtze River Delta region were suspended, the local railway operator said. There are fears transmission could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel during the holiday, although many have cancelled their plans. Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of such screenings. In an illustration of how such efforts could miss cases, doctors at a Paris hospital said that two of the three Chinese nationals in France who have been diagnosed with the virus had arrived in the country without showing symptoms. The World Health Organisation this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency. A report by infectious disease specialists at Imperial College, London on Saturday said that despite this, the epidemic \"represents a clear and ongoing global health threat\" adding: \"It is uncertain at the current time whether it is possible to contain the continuing epidemic within China.\" While China has called for transparency in managing the crisis, after cover-up of the 2002\/2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome spread, officials in Wuhan have been criticised for their handling of the current outbreak. In rare public dissent, a senior journalist at a Hubei newspaper run by the ruling Communist Party called on Friday for a \"immediate\" change of leadership in Wuhan on the Twitter-like Weibo. The post was later removed. Hubei province, where authorities are rushing to build a 1,000 bed hospital in six days, announced on Saturday that there were 658 patients affected by the virus in treatment, 57 of whom were critically ill.

The epicentre of the SARS-like virus is in central China, but it has spread to other regions, prompting authorities as far as the nation's northern capital to close tourist attractions and cancel public events to prevent further contagion from a disease that has killed dozens and infected more than 1,000. Authorities even decided to stop long-distance bus services to and from the capital of 20 million from Sunday as part of efforts to control the spread of the virus, state media reported. Security guards loitered in front of Beijing's Lama Temple on Chinese New Year, shooing away anyone who lingered for too long.

Wearing a white surgical mask, Li told AFP she had planned to burn incense at Lama Temple, before realising it was closed. In the capital of 20 million, where health authorities have reported at least 39 infected patients, famous landmarks were closed to prevent the virus from spreading, including the historic Forbidden City and a section of the Great Wall. The Ming Tombs and Yinshan Pagoda are also not open to visitors. Beijing Ditan and Longtan Temple Fairs - held for roughly three decades according to state media - were also cancelled. In central Hubei province, where the majority of cases have emerged, more drastic measures were taken: travel restrictions have been imposed in cities housing 56 million people. \"When we left home, it (the virus) wasn't that serious yet,\" said a 40-year-old woman, who arrived in Beijing from southern Guangdong province before the closures began. \"I am worried, but I also feel like worrying too much is useless,\" she added. \"It's better to face it head-on.\" At a shopping district near Beijing's Houhai lake, where tourists buy street food and souvenirs, many restaurants were open on the first day of Spring Festival. The narrow streets were festooned with red lanterns and Chinese flags, while food stalls sold snacks like stinky tofu and sugar-coated fruit. But there were fewer people than normal, pointed out Huo, a 63-year-old Beijing native who only offered his surname. \"There's definitely an impact (from the virus),\" he said. \"Look at how few people there are.\" But when asked whether he was worried about the virus, Huo remained nonchalant. \"In 2003, SARS was much worse,\" he told AFP, referring to an outbreak that killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong. \"I don't have to wear a mask because everyone else is,\" joked another man, who had travelled from eastern Shandong province. \"There's no point in worrying,\" he added. Some tourists also felt they had no choice but to go through with travel plans to Beijing despite the closures and risk of infection. At the upscale Taikoo Li shopping district, a 26-year-old woman said her hotel refused to refund her booking. \"Some people are over-panicking,\" she told AFP, explaining that some friends were worried about getting infected, even while staying at home. \"The atmosphere is a bit tense this year,\" agreed another woman, a 47-year-old who gave her surname as Zhang.

The man, who had not displayed any symptoms of the Wuhan virus during his flight to Singapore, had stayed at Village Hotel Sentosa after his arrival. However, he developed a cough on Thursday and went to the SKH Emergency Department the following day, where he was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated. Subsequent tests confirmed the Wuhan coronavirus infection at about 9.30pm on Saturday. MOH said it has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify those who had close contact with him.

Three cases of the virus have been confirmed in France while Chinese authorities have said the death toll there has risen to more than 40 with around 1,300 infected. The French firm, which makes brands including Peugeot and Citroen, said in a statement the evacuation was being \"implemented in full cooperation with the Chinese authorities and French consulate general\" and involved 38 people made up of staff members and their families working in the Wuhan region. They would be quarantined in the city of Changsha, around 300 kilometres (180 miles) from Wuhan where the virus originated, before being allowed to return \"to their countries of origin\", the company said in a statement. The first cases to be confirmed in Europe were announced by French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn on Friday. Others were \"being monitored\", said Paris emergency service chief Pierre Cali, without giving an exact figure. \"We are going to have patients suspected of having the virus, there are going to be (more) cases,\" warned Yazdan Yazdanpanah, head of infectious diseases at Paris's Bichat hospital where two of the three cases were being treated. Yazdanpanah said they were a couple from Wuhan, a man aged 31 and a woman aged 30, who arrived in France on January 18 as part of a trip. The other case involved a 48-year-old man, originally from China, who returned to France on January 22 after having \"passed through Wuhan\", according to Buzyn. He has been in hospital in the southwestern French city since Thursday after contacting doctors with a high temperature and a cough. \"Ten to 15 people\" who had been in contact with him had come forward, Bordeaux mayor Nicolas Florian said, adding that Chinese New Year festivities planned for Sunday had been cancelled by organisers \"as a precaution\". An in-depth investigation into the three cases was launched which identified all those who had had close contact with the three patients to ensure that they were properly monitored to prevent the spread of the virus, French health ministry officials said.

Fifteen more people have died and at least 688 new cases of the coronavirus have now been confirmed, according to the National Health Commission. Among the new deaths, 13 were in Hubei, the province at the heart of the outbreak, while Shanghai reported its first death. Chinese authorities have so far reported 1,975 cases nationwide. President Xi Jinping warned on Saturday that China faced a \"grave situation\" as authorities raced to contain a respiratory illness that has caused the widespread abandonment of Chinese New Year celebrations nationwide and overwhelmed health facilities in Hubei. The contagion remained centred on the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan, which accounted for seven of the new deaths and 46 of the new confirmed cases, said the Hubei Health Commission. Wuhan and more than a dozen other cities in the province have been locked down in a rapidly expanding quarantine effort marked by transport shutdowns and other restrictions on movement. A second major Chinese city is set to halt long-distance buses as China scrambles to contain the deadly virus. Starting Monday, Tianjin - a city of about 15 million inhabitants - will suspend long-distance buses and chartered buses that enter and leave the city, local officials said on their official Twitter-like Weibo account, a day after Beijing announced a similar measure. China also announced a partial lockdown in the southern city of Shantou, the first such measure taken outside the epicentre of the disease. From midnight, non-emergency vehicles will be prohibited from entering the city of 5.6 million people, which is a 1,100-kilometre drive from Wuhan, the heart of the epidemic. People arriving at Shantou train stations will be screened and \"urged to return\", said city authorities. Buses, ferries, public transport and taxis will be suspended, Shantou authorities said on their official social media account. The measures are to \"spare no efforts in doing a good job of preventing and controlling\" the epidemic, Shantou officials said, and to \"cut off the channels of spreading the virus\". The previously unknown virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) pathogen, which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. It also has struck at possibly the worst time for China, when hundreds of millions of people are travelling across the country or overseas to celebrate the Chinese New Year holiday, China's most important festival. Instead of New Year revelry, Wuhan has been seized by an eerie calm that deepened on Sunday as new restrictions banned most road traffic in the metropolis of 11 million. Loudspeakers broke the silence by offering tips slathered with bravado. \"Do not believe in rumours. Do not spread rumours. If you feel unwell, go to the hospital in time,\" the message said. \"Wuhan is a city that dares to face difficulties and keeps overcoming them,\" the female voice added, mentioning the deadly 2002-03 SARS epidemic and 1998 Yangtze River flooding. But some foreigners in Wuhan expressed deep concern, saying they feared going outside even though their food supplies were running low. \"The bustling city looks like a ghost town from my window. The shops are all shut down,\" Bangladeshi doctoral candidate Israt Zahan told AFP by phone. \"I am rationing the food at my home.

Whether the outbreak will continue to spread at this rate depends on the effectiveness of control measures, the scientists who conducted the studies said. But to be able to contain the epidemic and turn the tide of infections, control measures would have to halt transmission in at least 60 per cent of cases. The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak jumped to 56 on Sunday (Jan 26), with close to 2,000 people infected worldwide - the vast majority in China. \"It is unclear at the current time whether this outbreak can be contained within China,\" said Neil Ferguson, an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College London who co-led one of the studies. Ferguson's team suggest as many as 4,000 people in Wuhan were already infected by Jan 18 and that on average each case was infecting two or three others. A second study by researchers at Britain's Lancaster University also calculated the contagion rate at 2.5 new people on average being infected by each person already infected. \"Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan, we predict (it) will be substantially larger by Feb. 4,\" the scientists wrote.

Australia, a popular destination for Chinese visitors, confirmed its first four cases of the virus in travellers from China, all of whom had been to Wuhan. \"What we need is more data to be published on risk factors, transmission, incubation period and epidemiology, so we can understand what control measures are most appropriate,\" MacIntyre said.

Here's what China has been doing as it struggles to contain the virus that has spread within the country and overseas. Thirteen cities have been quarantined in an attempt to contain the virus. Transport such as trains, buses and passenger boats were halted from leaving and entering Wuhan as the city was placed under effective lockdown. Those already on their way have been ordered to return to their starting points. Airlines, including Singapore Airlines\u2019 budget arm Scoot, have cancelled flights in and out of the city. Other cities in Hubei province \u2013 such as Zhijiang, Xiantao and Huanggang \u2013 have also experienced lockdowns and transport closures, affecting about 56 million people. The province has announced it will stop operating online taxis and impose passenger restrictions on the roads. The southern city of Shantou announced a partial lockdown on Jan 26, the first city to implement such a measure outside the epicentre for the disease. Authorities in Beijing, Xi\u2019an and Tianjin have also announced they are suspending long-distance and chartered buses that enter and leave their cities. The Chinese government has dispatched 450 military medics to Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus. This is in response to the rising number of cases in the city, where hospitals are overwhelmed and medical supplies are running low. Many of these medics are experienced in dealing with infectious diseases such as SARS and Ebola. People waiting at a hospital in Wuhan said they have been waiting hours, even days, to see the doctor. The city is building two makeshift hospitals to add hundreds of beds to meet demand. Work on the first facility began on Friday (Jan 24) and it could be ready in just over a week, say state media. It is being built around a holiday complex originally intended for local workers. Prefabricated buildings, which will have 1,000 beds, will be put up, said the Changjiang Daily. \"The construction of this project is to solve the shortage of existing medical resources,\" the report said. \"Because it will be prefabricated buildings, it will not only be built fast but it also won't cost much.\" Several tourist spots in the country have been shut down as a result of the outbreak. Shanghai Disneyland said on its website it would temporarily close from Saturday \"in response to the prevention and control of the disease outbreak and in order to ensure the health and safety\" of its guests and staff.

Many people on social media have been calling for the week-long holiday to be extended to help prevent further spread of the virus. WeChat, China's ubiquitous messaging app, warned that it could ban accounts spreading rumours. China has called for transparency in managing the crisis, after a cover-up of the spread of the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002\/2003 eroded public trust, but officials in Wuhan have been criticised for their handling of the current outbreak. \"People in my hometown all suspect the real infected patients number given by authorities,\" said Violet Li, who lives in the Wuhan district where the seafood market is located. \"I go out with a mask twice a day to walk the dog - that's the only outdoor activity,\" she told Reuters by text message. Many cinemas across China are also closed with major film premieres postponed, slashing revenues. Theatres in the country took in just 1.81 million yuan (US$262,167) from tickets on Saturday, a tiny fraction of the 1.46 billion yuan on Chinese New Year's Day in 2019, according to data from movie-ticketing company Maoyan. Cruise operators including Royal Caribbean Cruises, Costa Cruises, MSC Cruises and Astro Ocean Cruises said that they cancelled a combined 12 cruises that had been scheduled to embark from Chinese ports before Feb 2. On Saturday, Hong Kong declared a virus emergency, scrapped celebrations and restricted links to mainland China. Hong Kong Disneyland and the city's Ocean Park theme park were closed on Sunday. Shanghai Disneyland, which expected 100,000 visitors daily through the Chinese New Year holidays, has already closed. In Hong Kong, with five confirmed cases, the city's leader Carrie Lam said on Saturday that flights and high speed rail trips between the city and Wuhan will be halted. Schools in Hong Kong that are currently on Chinese New Year holidays will remain closed until Feb 17. On Saturday, Canada declared the first \"presumptive\" confirmed case of the virus in a resident who had returned from Wuhan. The patient, a male in his 50s, arrived in Toronto on Jan 22 and was hospitalised the next day after developing symptoms of respiratory illness, officials said. Australia confirmed its first four cases on Saturday, Malaysia confirmed four and France reported Europe's first cases on Friday. The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. There are fears transmission could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel during the holiday, although many have cancelled their plans and airlines and railways in China are providing full refunds for tickets. Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of such screenings. In an illustration of how such efforts could miss cases, doctors at a Paris hospital said two of the three Chinese nationals in France who have been diagnosed with the virus had arrived in the country without showing any symptoms. A report by infectious disease specialists at Imperial College, London on Saturday said the epidemic \"represents a clear and ongoing global health threat,\" adding: \"It is uncertain at the current time whether it is possible to contain the continuing epidemic within China.\" Full coverage: https:\/\/cna.asia\/wuhan-virus","summary":"BEIJING: China on Sunday (Jan 26) banned wildlife trade nationwide in markets, supermarkets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms due to the coronavirus outbreak, the country's market watchdog, agricultural ministry, and forestry bureau said in a joint statement.

National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei, speaking at a press briefing, said authorities' knowledge of the new virus was limited and they are unclear on the risks posed by mutations of the virus. Ma said the incubation period for the coronavirus can range from one to 14 days, and that the virus is infectious during incubation, which was not the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003. Containment efforts, which have thus far included transportation and travel curbs and the cancellation of big events, will be intensified, Ma told a crowded news briefing on the second day of the Chinese New Year holiday. The central Chinese city of Wuhan and more than a dozen other cities in Hubei province have been locked down in a rapidly expanding quarantine effort marked by transport shutdowns and other restrictions on movement. The virus, believed to have originated late last year in a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife, has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Australia, France, the US and Canada. On Sunday, China announced a nationwide ban on the sale of wildlife in markets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms. Chinese authorities have so far reported 1,975 cases nationwide.

Like SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which was traced to bats and civets, the virus that has killed dozens in China and infected almost 2,000 people is believed to have originated in animals trafficked for food. Final findings are yet to be announced, but Chinese health officials believe it came from wildlife sold illegally at a market in the central city of Wuhan that offered enough animals to fill a zoo, including civets, rats, snakes, giant salamanders and live wolf pups. The so-called \"bushmeat\" trade, plus broader human encroachment on wild habitats, is bringing us into ever-closer contact with animal viruses that can spread rapidly in our uber-connected world, said Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a global NGO focused on infectious disease prevention. The Global Virome Project, a worldwide effort to increase preparedness for pandemics, which Daszak is a part of, estimates there are 1.7 million undiscovered viruses in wildlife, nearly half of which could be harmful to humans. Daszak said the project's research indicates we can expect around five new animal-borne pathogens to infect humanity each year. \"The new normal is that pandemics are going to happen more frequently,\" he said. \"We are making contact with animals that carry these viruses more, and more, and more.\" Viruses are a natural part of the environment, and not all are the stuff of sci-fi horror. But the recent track record of animal-hosted viruses that \"jump\" to humans is sobering. Like SARS, which killed hundreds in China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003, Ebola also was traced to bats, while HIV has roots in African primates. Today, more than 60 per cent of new emerging human infectious diseases reach us via animals, scientists say. Even familiar menu items like poultry and cattle - whose pathogens we have largely adapted to over millennia - occasionally throw a curveball, like bird flu or mad-cow disease. \"For the sake of these wild species' future, and for human health, we need to reduce consumption of these wild animals,\" said Diana Bell, a wildlife disease and conservation biologist at University of East Anglia who has studied SARS, Ebola and other pathogens. \"But, 17 years on (from SARS), apparently that hasn't happened.\" Wild-meat consumption itself is not necessarily dangerous - most viruses die once their host is killed. But pathogens can jump to humans during the capture, transportation, or slaughter of animals, especially if sanitation is poor or protective equipment not used. With scrutiny rising amid the viral outbreak, China on Sunday ordered a temporary ban on wildlife trading until the viral epidemic eases. But conservationists say China has repeatedly failed to deliver on pledges to crack down. Chinese authorities have addressed the problem partly by encouraging a farmed-animal industry. This has included for endangered species like tigers, whose parts are prized in China and other Asian countries as aphrodisiacs or for other uses. But that comes with its own downside, by providing a channel for more sought-after wild-caught beasts to be laundered as \"farmed\", Bell said. She added that wildlife traders also had become more savvy, avoiding market scrutiny by selling directly to restaurants. Environmental groups say Chinese demand, fuelled by rising consumer buying power, is the biggest driver of the global bushmeat trade today. Some rare species have been prized in China as delicacies or for unproved health benefits since ancient times. Traditionally, a host gains \"face\" by serving guests or business partners expensive, hard-to-acquire wild fare. Yang Zhanqiu, a pathogen biologist at Wuhan University, said modern demand also is bolstered by widespread distrust of a Chinese food industry tarnished by years of repeated safety scandals. \"People will think: Wild is natural, natural is safe,\" Yang said. \"Everyone wants to eat better, so there is a market for wild animals.\" Daszak said \"it's very difficult to stop an activity with 5,000 years of cultural significance\". But recent surveys strongly indicate that China's younger generation - swayed partly by animal-rights campaigns involving popular Chinese celebrities - are much less inclined to tuck into bat, rat, or salamander, he added. \"I think that in 50 years this will be a thing of the past,\" Daszak said. \"The problem is that we live in such an interconnected world today that any pandemic like this can spread globally in three weeks.\"","summary":"SHANGHAI: The animal-borne SARS virus 17 years ago was supposed to be a wake-up call about consuming wildlife as food, but scientists say China's latest epidemic indicates that the practice remains widespread and a growing risk to human health.

But she said she didn't want to leave on the chartered flight if it meant carrying the virus back home. \"I'm not going to endanger anybody else. And that's just erring on the side of caution,\" she told the broadcaster. France is also planning to evacuate its citizens stuck in Hubei province by bus, and French carmaker PSA - which has a sizable presence in Wuhan - said it was formulating plans to evacuate staff and relatives for quarantine in a neighbouring province.

The city of 11 million is the epicentre of the new SARS-like epidemic and has been in quarantine since Thursday (Jan 23) - with nobody allowed to leave as the government tries to contain its spread. At one Wuhan hospital AFP visited, there were long queues of sick patients, many coughing, with overwhelmed staff unable to process them quickly. Outside the Red Cross facility - which is one of the hospitals people are sent to for initial tests if they show signs of infection - patients told AFP they felt exasperated and helpless. \"It has been two days since I slept, and I have been wandering from hospital to hospital,\" said a man in his 30s, who was trying to see a doctor because he was worried he might be infected. \"At this rate, my turn will be tomorrow morning at best.\" Nearly 2,000 people have been infected across the country and 56 have died - mostly in Hubei. Those who spoke to AFP told of extremely long queues and disorganisation. One spoke of a fear that sick patients with fevers will infect each other while waiting in long queues, even if they didn't have the coronavirus when they first arrived at the hospital. Another man said he had seen several people faint while waiting. Many people carried their own plastic stools to sit on, while one pragmatic man had brought a lounge chair with him. Volunteers were taking patients to the hospital on Sunday after cars were ordered off the road. Authorised neighbourhood committees were transporting patients instead. \"There are no cars, so we are responsible for taking them there,\" said one volunteer, 40-year-old Yin Yu. The health crisis struck just before Chinese New Year - the most important date of the Chinese calendar, when millions of workers travel across the country to visit family - putting more pressure on the understaffed hospital. \"It takes at least five hours to see a doctor,\" one woman, who didn't want to be named, told AFP. The woman, who was with her son, said the management of the hospital was \"really messy\". An old man wearing a Mao cap said he had waited all day to see a doctor, only to be sent home because of a \"lack of room\". AFP saw some patients inside the hospital who were without masks, despite city orders that anyone going out must wear them. Patients were taking their own temperatures with mercury thermometers, by mouth or armpit, and there were no checks on anyone entering or leaving the hospital. And there was no sign that the flow of patients would ease up. \"Do not spread rumours. If you feel unwell, go to the hospital in time,\" was the message played over loudspeakers in the city. Wuhan hospitals are \"saturated\", the Municipal Health Commission admitted to the People's Daily. Faced with a congested medical system, authorities are racing to build two hospitals of over a thousand beds each within two weeks, and deployed hundreds of medical reinforcements to Wuhan. Patients say more capacity is sorely needed. \"There is no more space, the staff are overwhelmed, there is a shortage of some medicine, and patients are being left to fend for themselves,\" said one 30-year-old. He showed AFP pictures on his smartphone of a patient lying on the floor attached to a respiratory device. AFP was unable to verify the authenticity of the photograph. The vast majority of cases have been reported in Hubei, and several Wuhan residents said they think the figure is far below the real number. One person said there were \"many deaths\" in the hospital, and he did not believe the bodies were properly removed. \"It was like a horror movie,\" he said.","summary":"WUHAN: Overwhelmed staff members, patients waiting for hours to see a doctor, people fending for themselves: Wuhan residents describe scenes of chaos from one swamped hospital struggling to cope with crowds who may be infected by the new coronavirus.

Defying the threat from a contagious respiratory illness that broke out in the city and has killed dozens of people, Zhang and other Wuhan residents are pitching in by driving sick fellow citizens to hospital. \"We're from Wuhan, and even though you guys are here to help us, our own citizens should also come out to (help),\" Zhang Lin told AFP journalists as he waited for a patient to emerge from a clinic for the drive back home. \"There has to be someone who does this.\" The 48-year-old Zhang and others have been enlisted by the government to provide the free service, and it is sorely needed. Wuhan has for days been the nucleus of a transport lockdown that began in the city of 11 million and has since been expanded to much of the rest of Hubei province, in an attempt to cut off transmission routes for the virus. Wuhan's public transport system has been halted, taxi services curtailed and, on Sunday, new restrictions were introduced banning most cars from the streets. Difficulty getting around adds another challenge for sick people who, even after they reach overwhelmed hospitals, may need to wait hours to see hard-pressed doctors. But drivers like Yin Yu have obtained special dispensation to drive for humanitarian reasons. \"There are no cars, so we are responsible for sending them there ... and taking them back. This is all for free,\" said Yin, 40. To many Chinese, such can-do attitudes are hardly surprising for Wuhan. The city, located in the centre of the country on the Yangtze River, was the starting point for an armed rebellion against the Qing dynasty in 1911 that ended imperial rule - and gave the city's people a reputation for toughness. That toughness was referenced in a public announcement blaring from a loudspeaker in the city on Sunday, which offered tips on hygiene and seeking medical care, but also a dose of civic pride. \"Wuhan is a city that dares to face difficulties and keeps overcoming them,\" said a female voice. \"This is not the first time we have faced a similar situation. In 1998 we fought against extreme (Yangtze River) flooding. In 2003 we fought SARS,\" it said, referring to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a national viral epidemic similar to the current one.","summary":"WUHAN, Hubei: Citizens of China's virus-stricken city of Wuhan have been told to stay indoors, avoid strangers and keep their cars off the road, but locals like Zhang Lin are refusing to sit by and watch their hometown suffer.

Hong Kong authorities had said they would convert \"Fai Ming Estate, an unoccupied public estate in Fanling, into temporary flats for quarantine and observation of close contact persons without symptoms if needed.\" Following the protest, the government said it would \"cease the related preparation work in Fai Ming Estate.\" Hong Kong has been convulsed with demonstrations over the last seven months centred on Hong Kong's relationship with mainland China: with some protesters railing against what they see as growing interference from Beijing. Hong Kong authorities have so far refused to categorically block the flow of visitors from mainland China across several land border crossings.","datetime":1580089440000,"date_time":1580123232000},{"title":"China extends New Year holiday to Feb 2 over Wuhan virus fears: Official","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/asia\/wuhan-virus-china-extends-chinese-new-year-holiday-feb-2-12352528","article":"BEIJING: China will extend the Lunar New Year holiday to Feb 2, the State Council said Monday (Jan 27), to try and reduce the spread of a virus which has killed 80 people and infected more than 2,700 nationwide.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited the central city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, as the government sought to signal it was responding seriously to the crisis. The total number of confirmed cases in China rose about 30 per cent to more than 2,700, about half of them in Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan. As worries grew around the world, Chinese territory Hong Kong, which has had eight confirmed cases, banned entry to people who had visited Hubei in the past 14 days. The ban does not cover Hong Kong residents. The number of deaths from the flu-like virus in Hubei climbed to 76 from 56, health officials said, with five deaths elsewhere in China, including the southern island province of Hainan, which reported its first fatality on Monday. While a small number of cases have been confirmed in more than 10 countries, linked to people who travelled from Wuhan, no deaths have been reported elsewhere. Premier Li is the most senior leader to visit Wuhan since the outbreak began. Clad in a blue protective suit and mask, he inspected efforts to contain the epidemic and spoke to patients and medical staff, the government said. The government is extending the week-long Chinese New Year holiday by three days to Feb 2, in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. The Chinese New Year is usually a time for millions of people to travel, but many have had to cancel their plans because of travel curbs over the virus. China has locked down Hubei in the country's centre, an unprecedented operation affecting tens of millions of people and intended to slow transmission of the respiratory virus. Its ability to spread appears to be \"getting stronger\" though it is \"not as powerful as SARS\", top Chinese health officials said at a press conference. The previously unknown virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pathogen, which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Outside the epicentre, Shandong province and four cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an and Tianjin - announced bans on long-distance buses entering or leaving, a move that will affect millions of people travelling over the Lunar New Year holiday. The populous southern province of Guangdong, Jiangxi in the centre, and three cities made it mandatory for residents to wear face masks in public. Originating in Hubei's capital of Wuhan, the virus has spread throughout China and across the world - with cases confirmed in around a dozen countries including as far away as the United States. The US State Department said on Sunday it was arranging a flight from Wuhan to San Francisco for consulate staff and other Americans in the city. France's government and the French carmaker PSA also said they planned to evacuate staff and families, who will be quarantined in a city in a neighbouring province. Japan is coordinating with Beijing to swiftly evacuate its citizens, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said. Saudi Arabia asked its nationals present around Wuhan to contact its embassy for evacuation, while Jordan said it had obtained permission from Beijing to move its citizens from the city out of the country. Instead of New Year revelry, Wuhan has been seized by an eerie calm that deepened on Sunday as new restrictions banned most road traffic in the metropolis of 11 million. Loudspeakers broke the silence by offering tips slathered with bravado. \"Do not believe in rumours. Do not spread rumours. If you feel unwell, go to the hospital in time,\" the message said. \"Wuhan is a city that dares to face difficulties and keeps overcoming them,\" the female voice added, mentioning the deadly 2002-03 SARS epidemic and 1998 Yangtze River flooding. The health emergency has overwhelmed Wuhan's hospitals with patients, prompting authorities to send hundreds of medical reinforcements, including military doctors, and start construction on two field hospitals. The number of confirmed cases in the city could rise by 1,000, Wuhan's mayor Zhou Xianwang predicted on Sunday, based on the number currently undergoing observation in hospital. He also said around five million people had left the city during the new year travel rush. Speaking at a press conference and wearing a face mask, Zhou said the city's medical staff were \"very strained and tired\". With non-essential vehicles banned from the road, volunteers stepped up to drive sick fellow citizens to hospitals. \"There has to be someone who does this,\" Zhang Lin, 48, told AFP journalists as he waited for a patient to emerge from a clinic for the drive back home in nearly deserted streets. Some foreigners in Wuhan expressed deep concern, saying they feared going outside. \"We want to be evacuated as soon as possible, because either the virus, the hunger or the fear will kill us,\" Mashal Jamalzai, a political science student from Afghanistan at Central China Normal University, told AFP. The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that a Wuhan market where animals including rats, snakes and hedgehogs were reportedly sold is \"highly relevant\" to the outbreak, state news agency Xinhua reported on Monday. On Sunday, the government said it was banning all trade in wildlife until the emergency is over, but conservationists complain that Beijing has previously failed to deliver on such pledges. Animal rights groups called for the ban to be made permanent, saying it could end the possibility of future outbreaks. Health officials said the virus has since become transmissible between humans. At a press briefing in Beijing, CDC head Gao Fu said the disease \"is indeed ... not as powerful as SARS.\" However, it also appears that the \"spreading ability of the virus is getting stronger,\" said Ma Xiaowei, head of China's national health commission.

NORWICH: The SARS outbreak in 2002 to 2003 was the first global pandemic of the 21st century. There were over 8,400 reported cases and 11 per cent of those infected with the virus died. Its cause was a newly identified coronavirus (a type of virus that causes respiratory infections): SARS Co-V. Early cases were linked to wildlife markets and restaurants in Guangdong, China, where researchers found SARS-like coronaviruses in animals including masked palm civets and a racoon dog. A Chinese government team subsequently reported that 66 out of 508 wildlife handlers tested in other markets across Guangdong were positive for antibodies to the SARS virus. The Chinese authorities responded by imposing a temporary ban on the hunting, sale, transportation and export of all wild animals in southern China. They also quarantined or culled civets reared for human consumption in the many civet farms across the area. Civets testing positive for SARS may have secondary infections rather being than the source of the virus. They were probably infected during the \u201cspeed dating\u201d of zoonotic viruses circulating among the jumble of different animal species packed together at markets or while being transported to markets, often in China. At the Royal Society\u2019s international conference on Lessons from SARS in 2004 and in the related publication, we emphasised that wildlife trade was a threat to human health and a primary cause of biodiversity decline in China and South-East Asia. But here we are again, 17 years later, with another novel zoonotic coronavirus, this time in Wuhan, China. Once again, initial human cases were linked to a market selling a variety of live animals. A constantly changing range of species have been selected as the culprits in the past few days, including bats and snakes, (the latter results were quickly refuted), and even crickets and wolf cubs. But, as yet, there is no scientific evidence that the virus has been isolated from any of these, although a recent report stated that \u201c15 environmental specimens collected in the western section (of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market) were positive for 2019-nCoV virus through testing and genetic sequencing analysis\u201d. The report continues: \u201cDespite extensive searching, no animal from the market has thus far been identified as a possible source of infection.\u201d It is not evident what \u201cenvironmental specimens\u201d refers to here and a complete list of those animals present in, or available from, the market would be appropriate to release together with details of which and how many of these have so far been tested. Wild rodents, which are often present in these markets, should also have been collected and tested as SARS-like coronaviruses have also been isolated from wild rats in China. But we may be chasing our tails, as animals testing positive may not be the source of the current outbreak. We need to step back and learn the broader lessons here. The perfect conditions for the emergence of human pandemics from previously unknown zoonotic pathogens has been created as a result of three things. First, the shift from subsistence hunting of wildlife to its sale into an international trade network largely driven by demand in China. Second, the extensive cross-exposure within this wildlife trade of species and species populations, which would not mix or be in contact in the wild. And, third, the exploitation of new source populations as areas become depleted of target species. It is also important to emphasise that these wild animals are typically now more expensive to buy (sometime a status symbol) than domestic livestock, so the demand that perpetuates wildlife trade in the region is a dietary choice and not driven by low income. The solution is collective action to remove the demand and also the supply chains to these wildlife markets and \u201cfarms\u201d (often laundering animals from the wild rather than breeding them). The call to close wildlife markets across China \u2013 which started following the SARS outbreak \u2013 has also been echoed by experts in China and in external organisations worldwide, such as the Wildlife Conservation Society. We have to hope that the Wuhan outbreak is a wake-up call for regulation of wildlife trade and animal health, action that is urgently needed to protect human health and the environment.

As the death toll from the Chinese epidemic jumped to 80 with those affected worldwide approaching 3,000, analysts said there were growing fears the crisis could become as bad as the SARS outbreak that hammered Asian markets in 2003. The outbreak of the coronavirus has led China to lock down the epicentre of the disease Wuhan - a city of 11 million people - while imposing tight travel restrictions on a number of other cities including Beijing. The move comes during the Chinese New Year holiday when hundreds of millions of people criss-cross the country and spend billions of dollars. The government decided late Sunday it would extend the holiday and related school closures beyond the original Jan 30 end date to \"reduce population flows\", state media said. The outbreak has led to the cancellation of Chinese New Year festivities, along with temporary closures of Beijing's Forbidden City, Shanghai's Disneyland and a section of the Great Wall. Stephen Innes at AxiCorp warned the economic shock to China and the world - just as a growth slowdown appeared to be easing - could be massive. \"The biggest threat to the global economy is not just because the disease spreads quickly across countries through networks related to global travel,\" he said in a note. \"But also because any economic shock to China's colossal industrial and consumption engines will spread rapidly to other countries through the increased trade and financial linkages associated with globalisation.\" He added: \"Unlike 2003 where SARS was less impactful on the developed world market, the rest of the world could feel the pinch this time around.\" If the new virus has the same impact on China as SARS, the falls could be worse then projected, Innes said, because consumption is a bigger part of the country's economy and its overall growth trajectory is weaker. Most regional markets were closed for the Chinese New Year break but Tokyo was open and fell 1.9 per cent by the break. Wellington, Manila and Jakarta also dropped. Both main oil contracts tumbled more than 2 per cent, having dropped more than 6 per cent last week owing to concerns about the effects on demand in the world's number two economy. The flight to safety saw the yen rally against the dollar, with the unit now up more than 1 per cent from eight-month lows touched earlier this year. Gold, another go-to asset in times of turmoil and uncertainty, is heading back towards US$1,600 and the six-year peaks touched at the start of January. While the main focus is on the spread of the virus, traders will also be keeping an eye on the release of earnings this week from top companies including Apple, Facebook and Samsung.","summary":"HONG KONG: Fears over the global economic impact of the deadly China virus sent oil prices plunging more than 2 per cent on Monday (Jan 27) to extend last week's sell-off, while safe-haven assets including the yen and gold rallied.

The task force is co-chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong. Among other measures, Mr Wong announced at a media conference that people should defer all non-essential travel to mainland China, an extension from an earlier advisory to defer all travel to Hubei. \"We are doing this now because of the latest developments in China which the China government itself has described as grave and they have also said the virus is getting stronger and infections will continue to rise,\" said Mr Wong. Given Singapore's status as an international transport hub, Mr Wong said this extended travel advisory is a necessary safeguard against further spread of the virus. Authorities will also strengthen border measures by implementing temperature screening for all incoming flights by Wednesday, Mr Wong said. Thermal scanners will be deployed at the piers of the airport to cover all incoming flights, he added. Currently, temperature screening is only conducted for passengers on flights from China at air checkpoints. Temperature screening will continue at land checkpoints for bus, car and train arrivals and at sea checkpoints. There will also be additional attention given to flights from mainland China at the aerobridge. These include visual identification of unwell travellers for evaluation by the medical team. Travellers deemed unwell with fever or respiratory symptoms, or have relevant travel history to Hubei, will be referred to nursing stations. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will also check passengers who are in possession of passports issued in Hubei. Such passengers will be referred for attention to ensure that they are well, and to obtain their contact details to expedite subsequent contact tracing if required. There will also be \"extra precautions\" taken for the workforce and students returning from mainland China, Mr Wong said. For students returning from China from Tuesday, they will be given a Leave of Absence (LOA) for 14 days so they can stay at home and minimise close contact with others. The minister said organisations have been advised to collect health and travel declarations from employees returning from mainland China from Tuesday. \"We are doing this now, we are getting ready now because we fully expect more to come back after the Chinese New Year holidays,\" he added. More stringent precautions are in place for organsiations with staff who have close contact and sustained interactions with vulnerable populations. These measures will apply to schools, including preschools, healthcare and eldercare facilities. Employers in these sectors will need to issue a Leave of Absence for 14 days upon their workers' return to Singapore. The general workforce is recommended to follow these measures as well. Employers may adopt additional precautionary measures if they choose to do so. Mr Wong said: \"We have no evidence that there is community spread of the virus in Singapore. But it may happen. And if it does we stand ready to take additional measures.\" \"I want to assure Singaporeans that we will do everything we can to protect Singaporeans and Singapore, but this does not mean overreacting or worse turning xenophobic. We must be proactive and rational in our response and base our actions on the available evidence and data,\" the minister added. The most important defence is still at the individual level. To beat the virus, it would not be enough for the Government to act alone, he said. Singapore has so far confirmed four cases of the SARS-like virus - the fourth was announced early Sunday morning. The first case of the novel coronavirus in Singapore was announced on Thursday, while two cases were confirmed on Friday. Contact tracing has been activated for confirmed cases and as a precautionary step, Government quarantine facilities have been set up to house close contacts who are well. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said there were no new confirmed cases of the Wuhan virus in Singapore as of noon on Sunday, adding that it has been notified of 92 suspected cases in total. Of the 92 suspected cases, 46 have tested negative for the new coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China. Test results for the remaining 42 cases are pending.

This applies to all students and staff of government schools, including MOE kindergartens, primary, secondary, special education schools, junior colleges and the Millenia Institute, who return from mainland China on Jan 15 or later. For polytechnics and Institutes of Technical Education (ITEs), which reopen a day earlier on Tuesday, the leave of absence for students and staff applies if they return from China on Jan 14 or later. The leave of absence will last for 14 days, starting from the day after their arrival in Singapore. This duration mirrors the incubation period of the coronavirus. Students on leave of absence will be supported through a home-based learning plan, MOE said. Schools will also start daily temperature taking exercises when they reopen after the Chinese New Year holidays on Wednesday. Students and staff will be monitored for any signs of flu-like symptoms. More than 800 students and several staff members who travelled to mainland China will have to take a leave of absence, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung at a press conference on Monday. Two individuals from government schools - one student and one staff member - visited Hubei province in the past 14 days, while 712 students and 62 staff members visited mainland China in the same period. From polytechnics and ITEs, three individuals visited Hubei province, while 107 students and six staff members visited mainland China. \"We do expect the numbers to go up as travel declarations come in,\" Mr Ong said, although he highlighted that the numbers were \"fairly manageable\" considering the number of schools in Singapore. Pre-school students and staff members returning from mainland China to Singapore from Jan 14 will have to take a two-week leave of absence as well. All pre-schools were notified in an advisory from the Early Childhood Development Agency on Monday morning, said Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee. Mr Lee also said that pre-school operators should provide paid leave of absence to affected employees, and monitor their health. About 500 to 600 pre-school teachers had gone to or returned from China for various reasons such as study trips and vacations, he said. Out of the 180,000 pre-school children in Singapore, he estimated that about 1,000 would have gone to or returned from China. \"We believe it's manageable. We are closely working with some 400 pre-school operators to make sure that this is smoothly managed,\" he said. \"ECDA as well as MSF (Ministry of Social and Family Development) colleagues will be visiting various pre-schools to check on implementation and provide support to the sector.\" Singapore's six autonomous universities have agreed to implement the same measures, said Mr Ong. \"Of course, there are also other private institutions,\" he said. \"For international schools, we will be contacting them and advising them to follow the same protocol.\" Mr Ong said schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have also ensured that there will be no organised trips to China until the end of March. \"Students who are already in China, the IHLs are in the process of recalling them.\" The new coronavirus, which originated in China\u2019s Wuhan, has so far killed 80 people and infected more than 2,700. A handful of cases have been reported outside China, including four in Singapore. MOE had earlier instituted a range of measures to protect schools against the virus, including requiring students and staff to declare their travel history and advising those who travelled to China to take their temperature regularly upon their return. \u201cThe latest LOA (leave of absence) measure allows MOE to better mitigate the potential risks posed by travel in our schools and institutions, while enabling them to continue with the usual learning and other activities,\u201d the ministry said. The ministry also advised students and their families to monitor their health and adopt good personal hygiene habits. \u201cParents should seek immediate medical attention for their children if unwell, and ensure that their children recover fully before they return to school for classes,\u201d it said. Mr Ong said the leave of absence advisory is different from a quarantine order as individuals are not legally required to comply. \"Having said that, (the government schools and IHLs) are all part of MOE,\" he said. \"So as an organisation, we will be able to enforce it.

The State Council, China's cabinet, said Li would meet with patients and medical staff on the frontline. The premier was appointed head of a working group to tackle the epidemic, which began at a market in Wuhan that was selling wild animals for food. The group has already announced an extension to the Lunar New Year holiday originally scheduled to end on Jan 30 \"to reduce population flows\". Transport curbs have also been imposed around China to cut off transmission routes. Wuhan is already under virtual lockdown and severe limits on movement are in place in several other Chinese cities. The central city of 11 million people clamped down further on Monday, announcing the immediate suspension of visa and passport services for Chinese citizens until Jan 30.

Speaking at a multi-minister task force news conference on Monday (Jan 27), Mr Iswaran made this point by citing a case involving a post on HardwareZone Forum which was viewed by 4,600 unique visitors before it was eventually taken down. The post falsely claimed that someone in Singapore had died from the virus. The office overseeing the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) issued a general correction notice to SPH Magazines over the post. SPH Magazines, which operates HardwareZone Forum, complied with the correction notice in a post on Monday which included a link to the Factually article. SPH Magazines also said that HardwareZone.com had taken down the thread earlier, \"in line with its community guidelines\". For the facts of the case, the POFMA Office referred to a Factually article which said there have been no deaths among the confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus infection as of 11pm on Jan 26. Mr Iswaran said: \"Some who viewed the post would also have shared it with others and been misled by it. The Minister for Health had ascertained that there was a false statement of fact and was satisfied that it was in the public interest to issue a correction direction.\" \"We must take swift action against such falsehoods. Otherwise, there is a grave risk that they will spread and cause panic among our citizens.

He added that if any other cases come to the Government\u2019s attention, the same kind of evaluation would be applied and appropriate action taken. Mr Iswaran said the aim is to keep Singaporeans informed of the facts so that they can safely navigate the online terrain, discern truth from falsehood and know what they can do to lessen the risk to themselves and their family. He said his ministry is working closely with the Ministry of Health to regularly share important public information with citizens through multiple channels on social media and websites. \"The situation is fluid and we need the help and cooperation of the media, all Singaporeans and the residents in this critical national effort to prevent misinformation and falsehoods about the Wuhan coronavirus from sowing fear and causing panic in our society,\" he said.

At least 81 people have died since the new strain of coronavirus emerged in China's Wuhan, and millions are now under an effective quarantine, with all flights in and out of the city grounded and a ban on Chinese tour groups domestically and abroad. The measures come amid a boom in Chinese foreign travel, with the number of tourists from the country increasing nearly tenfold since 2003, according to a report by research firm Capital Economics. But businesses in destinations that rely on the huge numbers of Chinese tourists are already feeling the heat, with complaints of \"deserted\" beaches and shops, and concerns about the future. The outbreak carries echoes of the SARS crisis, which paralysed regional travel and battered local economies from late 2002. Chinese tourist numbers then fell by around a third. \"If they fell by a similar amount again, it would knock around 1.5-2.0 percentage points from (gross domestic product) in the most vulnerable countries,\" Capital Economics said. In Japan, the fall in Chinese visitors was already being felt in Asakusa, a popular tourist destination near the Sensoji temple. \"We've definitely been seeing less people this year,\" said Yoshie Yoneyama, 31, manager of a shop selling traditional Japanese sweets and a rice-based drink called amazake. \"I think there are less than half the numbers of last year or the year before,\" she told AFP. The number of Chinese holidaying in Japan has exploded from around 450,000 in 2003 to 8.4 million in 2018, accounting for 27 per cent of all inbound tourists as Tokyo works to expand the sector. But it will now be \"very difficult\" for Japan to achieve its target of 40 million tourists in 2020, Yuki Takashima, an economist at Nomura Securities, told AFP. And the effects will be felt beyond hotels, restaurants and tourist sites, because many Chinese tourists visit Japan specifically to shop. Electronic appliances and beauty products usually top of their lists, Takashima said, so retail outlets will see their bottom lines affected. The crisis has already sent Japan's key Nikkei index plunging, with stock in Shiseido - a cosmetics brand popular with Chinese tourists - plunging more than five percent on Monday. \"We can expect those stocks to continue to fall like dominoes,\" said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp. But he said Japan would be better placed to weather the storm than another top destination for Chinese tourists: Thailand. Tourism accounts for 18 per cent of the nation's GDP, with Chinese holidaymakers making up more than a quarter of total arrivals. The country's tourism minister has already warned a crisis on the scale of SARS could cost an estimated US$1.6 billion, and the effects are already clear in Phuket. \"For two days, the streets, the shops and the beaches have been deserted,\" said Claude de Crissey, who owns a 40-room hotel and a restaurant on the island. \"Phuket has focused almost exclusively on Chinese tourism ... if the situation continues, we will all be impacted,\" he told AFP. Australia too, already reeling from the effects of the bushfire crisis, is likely to feel the impact. Chinese visitor numbers doubled in the six years to June 2019, with mainlanders now accounting for 15 per cent of Australia's inbound tourists. Mario Hardy, CEO of the Pacific Asia Travel Association said it was hard to gauge how long the crisis would last. \"I would suspect the impact would be between three to six months, but it will really depend on how the situation evolves in the coming few weeks,\" he told AFP. In Japan, leather goods store owner Hayato Chiba said local businesses in the Ameyoko shopping district of Tokyo's Ueno were hoping for a swift resolution. \"An increasing number of shops in Ameyoko count on foreign customers, so it's getting a bit tough,\" said Chiba, 65, who represents around 400 local businesses. \"Something really serious is happening.

Alibaba said the measure applied across all its divisions, including to workers in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau as well as in mainland China. It employs more than 100,000 people worldwide, most of whom are in China. The Shanghai government also imposed a similar measure, announcing that all companies in the city would not be allowed to start work before Feb 9, as did the nearby city of Suzhou, home to a big industrial park for pharmaceutical firms and tech companies. The decision by the Shanghai government will affect companies such as Tesla Inc, General Motors and Volkswagen which either own factories or operate them in the city through ventures with local partners.

But Mr Wong, who co-chairs a multi-ministry task force spearheading Singapore's response to the outbreak, said it was too early to tell at this stage how the Wuhan virus compares to SARS. \"The medical experts tell us as of now that the virus is not as infectious as SARS, (the) fatality rate is lower as of now,\" he said. \"But the situation is evolving so quickly, and as you all heard from the Chinese authorities yesterday, the virus is getting stronger, the number of infections is likely to rise. \"So we just have to be psychologically prepared that this can get worse than SARS.\" Back in 2003, the SARS coronavirus infected 238 people in Singapore and killed 33, including doctors and healthcare workers. The virus spread through close contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.

Mr Wong stressed that Singapore is better prepared to deal with an outbreak after learning lessons from the SARS episode. \"We have put in place inter-ministry coordination mechanisms.

Mr Mak also said Singapore is collaborating with different healthcare stakeholders on improving its testing capabilities for the virus. \"(We are) seeing how we can use these capabilities to enhance our hospital and health services\u2019 ability to detect, screen and confirm the presence of such infections,\" he said.

As for the Wuhan coronavirus, Mr Wong said: \"Some of you asked: What if there is a risk of infections spreading even before symptoms show. \"If that were to happen, I think the spread of the virus will be much faster because we are unable to identify and isolate unlike SARS - we had the means to because of symptoms.\" Nevertheless, Mr Wong said there is no conclusive evidence yet to prove that the Wuhan virus is capable of spreading pre-symptoms. \"It's certainly something we are watching out for, because if indeed this is happening, then certainly, we will have to do more and escalate our measures even further.\" Mr Wong said there are many \"imponderables\" and \"uncertainties\" regarding the Wuhan virus, adding that Singapore has to be prepared that things could worsen with more cases in China and abroad. Minister Wong said the Government is prepared to \"marshal all available resources\" to fight the virus' spread.","datetime":1580150040000,"date_time":1580152274000},{"title":"Capgemini passes first hurdle in Altran bid despite Elliott resistance","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/business\/capgemini-passes-first-hurdle-in-altran-bid-despite-elliott-resistance-12358390","article":"French consulting and IT services provider Capgemini  succeeded in securing more than half of the capital of smaller rival Altran Technologies, the French market regulator AMF said on Monday, marking a win against U.S. activist fund Elliott.

The AMF said Capgemini holds 53.6per cent of Altran's share capital and at least 53.4per cent of the voting rights. The group - which faced a tussle with Altran shareholder Elliott over its offer price - had aimed to get the backing from just over half of Altran's investors to pursue its bid. Earlier in January Capgemini had slightly raised the price of its friendly bid for Altran to 14.5 euros a share from 14 euros, valuing the company at 3.7 billion euros (US$4.1 billion). That move failed to convince Elliott, which has built up a stake of over 15per cent in Altran, to tender its shares to the group's offer, which closed on Jan. 22. The AMF said Capgemini's offer would be reopened to other investors, though it did not give a fresh timeframe. Capgemini is hoping the deal will add to its services in industries from telecoms to aerospace and help it slash costs. Altran shares were up 1.4per cent after the results of Capgemini's offer were announced, a rare bright spot in a European stockmarket spooked by coronavirus fears.

It is one of two makeshift hospitals that Chinese authorities are rushing to build within a fortnight in the city of 11 million people to relieve medical facilities swamped with patients waiting for hours to see doctors. Work to build Fire God Mountain started Friday and is due to be ready to receive patients on Feb 3, according to state media. The second one, named \"Thunder God Mountain\", will be ready for use on Feb 5. The construction workers all wore masks as mandated by the authorities for the entire population of the city, which has been under lockdown since Thursday. They are checked for fevers when they arrived by bus and again during their breaks. They worked around a forest of excavators and trucks bringing in prefab material at the site on the southwestern side of the city. \"We have to work fast to combat the epidemic,\" a worker in his 30s, who refused to give his name, told AFP. He said he worked nine hours per day, \"sometimes less, sometimes more. It depends on what they need\". The 25,000-square-metre hospital will have between 700 and 1,000 beds to treat patients of a pneumonia-like virus that has killed 81 people - mostly in Wuhan - and infected more than 2,700 across the country. The second facility will have 1,300 beds. \"We've mobilised all the workers left in Wuhan to work in shifts to ensure round-the-clock construction,\" Zhang Chongxi, general manager of the road and bridge company of Wuhan Construction, was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency. Chen Bingzhong, a former health ministry official, said the facilities are needed because infectious diseases should not be treated in general hospitals. \"Because the infectious power of this virus is too strong, it will infect other patients, including medical staff,\" Chen told AFP. China has experience building hospitals in record time in periods of crisis. In 2003, it built a facility in Beijing within a week to treat patients during the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic. Authorities have used this as a model for the new facilities for the patients ill with the novel virus, which shares genetic similarities with SARS. Premier Li Keqiang visited one of the construction sites on Monday during his first trip to Wuhan since the health crisis erupted - a sign of the growing concern among the leadership in Beijing. \"Fast doesn't mean without quality,\" Li, who wore a mask, told the workers, according to videos of his visit. \"Fire God Mountain\" is being erected next to a residential building. A road outside the construction site is used to park dozens of trucks and construction vehicles. The city's new rallying cry - \"Let's go Wuhan!\" - was written on a banner across the front of a truck. Bulldozers flattened the earth, electricians installed 5G antennas and workers began to bury pipes. \"We are happy to help in this situation.

Lately, he has had trouble finding basic supplies such as milk and eggs in the city of 11 million since it became the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak that has killed 81 and infected 2,740 people in China. \"There's a shortage. Everyone wants to stock up, but it is already too late,\" Badeephak told Reuters via Skype. \"There are no vehicles on the road except private vehicles, which I only see going to pharmacies and hospitals,\" he added. Badeephak wants to go home to Thailand, he has little choice but to wait. The Thai government has put a military plane on standby for a possible evacuation of its citizens, but Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Monday (Jan 27) they do not yet have Beijing's permission for the airlift. Most commercial flights out of Wuhan were halted last week to try to contain the virus. \"At the moment the Chinese authorities have said the situation is still under control, so we have prepared a plan ...

The UN health body said in a situation report published late Sunday that the risk was \"very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level.\" In a footnote, the WHO said there had been an \"error\" in previous communications published on Thursday, Friday and Saturday which \"incorrectly\" said the global risk was \"moderate\". Asked for more detail, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said only that it was \"an error in the wording\". The WHO on Thursday stopped short of declaring the virus an international public health emergency - a rare designation used only for the most severe outbreaks that could trigger more concerted international action. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is visiting China this week to discuss further action to contain the virus, on Thursday said: \"This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency\". WHO's cautious approach can be seen in the context of past criticism over its slow or too hasty use of the term, first used for the deadly 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. During that outbreak, the UN health agency was criticised for sparking panic-buying of vaccines with its announcement that year that the outbreak had reached pandemic proportions, and then anger when it turned out the virus was not nearly as dangerous as first thought. But then in 2014, the WHO met harsh criticism for dragging its feet and downplaying the severity of the Ebola epidemic that ravaged three west Africa countries, claiming more than 11,300 lives by the time it ended in 2016.

The woman was \u201casymptomatic\u201d during her flight to Singapore, MOH said, adding that she later developed symptoms on Jan 24 and was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on Jan 26. She was then classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated at NCID. \u201cSubsequent test results confirmed Wuhan coronavirus infection on Jan 27,\" said MOH. The ministry added that she has no known links to the other confirmed imported cases. Before she was admitted to the hospital, the 56-year-old stayed with her family at their home at Ceylon Road, said MOH. She stayed at home after the onset of symptoms, until she was taken to hospital two days later. MOH said as of Monday at noon, 62 of the suspect cases tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus, and four tested positive. The fifth case involving the 56-year-old female was confirmed at 2pm. Test results for the remaining 57 cases are pending, the health authority said. MOH also identified 115 close contacts from the first four confirmed cases as of Monday at noon. Of the 86 who are still in Singapore, 75 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. The authority added efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 11 close contacts. \u201cContact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts,\u201d MOH explained. \u201cAs a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. \u201cIn addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.\u201d The deadly virus has killed 82 people in China so far, with more than 2,700 confirmed cases. Earlier on Monday, a recently formed multi-ministry task force announced Singapore will have a new set of stringent measures in an effort to contain the deadly coronavirus that originated from Wuhan. These measures include enhanced temperature screening and compulsory leave of absence for students and teachers returning from China. Singapore's first confirmed case was a 66-year-old Wuhan man who stayed at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa. This was followed by the confirmed cases of the man's 37-year-old son and a 53-year-old woman from Wuhan.

At least 106 people have died from the virus in China, and more than 4,000 people have been infected across the nation. Cases have been identified in more than a dozen other countries, including the first confirmed patients in Canada and Sri Lanka. The United States urged its citizens to \"reconsider\" all travel to China and told them not to go to central Hubei province, where the pneumonia-like virus emerged. Mongolia closed its vast border to vehicles from China. In a sign of the mounting official concern, Premier Li Keqiang visited ground zero to oversee containment efforts in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people where the disease first appeared late last month. The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, effectively trapping tens of millions of people, including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to contain the virus as the Chinese New Year holiday unfolds. China decided to extend the holiday, initially due to end on Jan 30, for three days to limit population flows and control the epidemic. US President Donald Trump said the United States has offered China \"any help that is necessary\" in combating the virus. The health commission in the capital said a 50 year-old-man who visited Wuhan died of respiratory failure on Monday, less than three weeks after visiting the city. More than 700 new infections were confirmed in the country, while the number of suspected cases doubled over a 24-hour period to nearly 6,000. The youngest infected patient was a nine-month-old baby being treated in Beijing. In Wuhan, AFP reporters saw construction workers labouring on one of two field hospitals that China is racing to complete by next week to relieve overcrowded facilities swamped with people waiting for medical attention. On day five under quarantine, residents shouted \"Go Wuhan\" from their windows, according to videos posted online, and a building lit up the night sky with the words in red. \"I'm getting more concerned every day,\" Do Quang Duy, a 32-year-old Vietnamese masters student in Wuhan, told AFP. Landlocked Mongolia - which is heavily dependent on trade with China - closed the border with its huge neighbour to cars, cancelled classes until Mar 2 and suspended large public gatherings. Malaysia banned visitors from Hubei province. Turkey and Germany advised their citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China altogether. A US-bound flight is scheduled to leave Wuhan on Tuesday with consular staff and some American citizens. France plans to fly citizens out of the city in the middle of this week. Japan will also bring its citizens home. Belgium, Bangladesh, India and Spain said they were working to repatriate their nationals, while Germany was considering the possibility. The World Health Organization last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted international trade or travel restrictions. But the world body said on Monday that the global risk from the deadly virus in China was \"high\", admitting an error in its previous reports that said it was \"moderate\". WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus headed to Beijing for discussions with Chinese officials. Global stock markets and oil prices plunged on Monday over coronavirus fears. The virus is believed to have jumped to people from animals in a Wuhan market that sold a wide range of exotic wild game. China on Sunday banned all wildlife trade until the emergency subsides. The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003 and was also traced to the wild game trade. Authorities around China have already imposed aggressive curbs on transport during the usually high-traffic Chinese New Year season to keep the virus from spreading. At Beijing's main international airport, almost all passengers wear masks. Fever checks are conducted at subway and railway stations. Typically, hundreds of millions of people criss-cross China in jam-packed buses and trains during the holiday, a time for family reunions. But the festivities have been ruined this year by the coronavirus, which can be transmitted between humans, with people told to avoid gatherings. Countless popular public attractions and seasonal festivals have been shut down. Several Beijing malls shortened their opening hours, according to state media. The nationwide measures threaten to put a dent in an economy that was already slowing down. Beijing and Shanghai were among places mandating stringent checks and 14-day observation periods for people arriving from Hubei. Wuhan's mayor Zhou Xianwang said around 5 million people had left the stricken city during the new year travel rush in January, highlighting fears the virus could spread further.

Health authorities in the capital, Beijing, reported the first coronavirus death on Monday of a 50-year-old person who had been to Wuhan, state media said. It was not immediately clear if the death was included in the total. All the deaths were in China. Li, clad in a blue protective suit and mask, thanked medical workers in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and the epicentre of the outbreak. \"Li ... thanked frontline medical workers for their all-out efforts in treating patients and urged them to pay attention to their own protection,\" Xinhua news agency said. \"He required efforts to guarantee medical resources supply, race against time to treat patients and ensure adequate market supply and stable prices.\" He said 2,500 more medical workers would arrive in the next two days. Li is the most senior leader to visit Wuhan since the outbreak began. He inspected efforts to contain the epidemic and was shown on state television leading medical workers in chants of \"Wuhan jiayou!\" - an exhortation to keep their strength up. He also visited the construction site of a new hospital due to be built in days. On China's heavily censored social media, where dissent is typically suppressed, local officials have borne the brunt of mounting public anger about the handling of the virus. Some lashed out at the Hubei governor, who had to correct himself twice during a news conference over the number of face masks being produced in the province. \"If he can mess up the data multiple times, no wonder the disease has spread so severely,\" one Weibo user said. Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster CCTV the city's management of the crisis was \"not good enough\" - rare public self-criticism for a Chinese official - and said he was willing to resign. The city of 11 million people is in virtual lockdown and much of Hubei, home to nearly 60 million people, is under some kind of travel curb. People from Hubei have come under scrutiny within mainland China as well, with many facing suspicion from officials about their recent travels. \"Hubei people are getting discriminated against,\" a Wuhan resident complained on the Weibo social media platform. A small number of cases linked to people who travelled from Wuhan have been confirmed in more than 10 countries, including Thailand, France, Japan and the United States. Investors are worried about the impact on travel, tourism and broader economic activity. The consensus is that in the short term, economic output will be hit as Chinese authorities impose travel restrictions and extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, when millions traditionally travel by rail, road and plane, by three days to limit the spread of the virus. Asian and European shares tumbled, with Japan's Nikkei average sliding 2 per cent, its biggest one-day fall in five months. Demand spiked for safe-haven assets such as the Japanese yen and Treasury notes. European stocks fell more than 2 per cent. During the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally, air passenger demand in Asia plunged 45 per cent. The travel industry is more reliant on Chinese travellers now than it was then. The total number of confirmed cases in China rose to 2,835, with about half in the central province of Hubei. But some experts suspect the number of infected people is much higher. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has had eight confirmed cases, banned entry to people who had visited Hubei in the past 14 days. The number of deaths from the virus in Hubei climbed to 76 from 56, officials said, with five deaths elsewhere in China. The newly identified coronavirus is believed to have originated late last year in a Wuhan market illegally selling wildlife. Much is not known, including how easily it spreads and just how deadly it is.

Analysts said there were growing fears the crisis could become as bad as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that hammered markets and the global economy in 2003. \"Coronavirus fears have gripped the markets ... as all the major European equity benchmarks are nursing big losses,\" said analyst David Madden at trading firm CMC Markets UK. \"Stocks that are connected to China are feeling the pain ... as traders are afraid the health crisis will curtail economic activity.\" The outbreak has led China to lock down the epicentre of the disease, Wuhan - a city of 11 million people - while imposing tight travel restrictions on a number of other cities including Beijing. The move comes during the Lunar New Year holiday when hundreds of millions of people criss-cross the country and spend huge amounts of money. Most Asian markets were closed for the Lunar New Year break but Tokyo was open and fell two percent. Bangkok plunged nearly three percent on worries about the Thai travel sector. The flight to safety saw the yen rally against the dollar, with the Japanese unit now up more than one percent from eight-month lows touched earlier this year. The dollar however rose against the euro and pound. Gold, another go-to asset in times of turmoil and uncertainty, seemed headed back towards US$1,600 per ounce and the six-year peaks touched at the start of January. While the main focus is on the spread of the virus, traders will also be keeping an eye on the release of earnings this week from top companies including Apple, Facebook and Samsung. The oil market had already tumbled more than six percent last week owing to concerns about the virus' effect on demand in China, which is the world's number two economy after the United States.

The US Commerce Department report on Monday (Jan 27) also showed downward revisions to sales for the prior three months, bucking a recent streak of fairly strong housing data. Strength in housing, following a slump in 2018 through the first half of 2019, could offset some of the drag on economic growth from weakness in business spending and manufacturing. New home sales slipped 0.4 per cent last month to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 694,000 units, with sales in the South dropping to the lowest in more than a year. It was the third straight monthly decline in sales. November's sales pace was revised down to 697,000 units from the previously reported 719,000. September and October sales were also marked down. \"Low mortgage rates, a robust labour market and stabilising geopolitical tensions suggest that demand for housing will stick around, and buyers are hungry for more housing options,\" said Matthew Speakman, economist at online real estate firm Zillow. Sales last month were concentrated in the US$200,000-US$749,000 price range. New homes priced below US$200,000, the most sought after, accounted for only 10 per cent of sales. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11.1 per cent of housing market sales, would increase 1.5 per cent to a pace of 730,000 units in December. The PHLX housing index fell, tracking a broadly weaker US stock market as investors worried about the economic fallout of the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak in China that has prompted the country to extend the Lunar New Year holidays and businesses to close some operations. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. US Treasury prices rallied. New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. Sales jumped 23.0 per cent from a year ago. For all of 2019, new home sales increased 10.3 per cent to 681,000 units, the highest since 2007. Cheaper mortgage rates have supported the housing market since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times last year. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 3.60 per cent from its peak of 4.94 per cent in November 2018, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. Officials from the US central bank are scheduled to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. They are expected to reiterate the Fed's desire to keep rates unchanged at least through this year, which could limit further declines in mortgage rates. Still, economists are optimistic the housing market will remain solid. \"Household formation trends are running ahead of new housing construction and this will buoy the housing market in 2020,\" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. Reports this month showed sales of previously owned homes jumped to near a two-year high in December and housing starts raced to a 13-year peak. Though permits for future construction of single-family housing permits fell in December, that followed seven straight monthly gains. Housing is expected to have contributed to GDP growth again in the fourth quarter. Residential investment rebounded in the third quarter after contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP to rise at a 1.8 per cent annualised rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1 per cent rate in the July-September period. The government will publish its snapshot of fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday. \"We still think that real residential investment posted a decent gain in the fourth quarter,\" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. The housing sector, which accounts for about 3.1 per cent of gross domestic product, remains constrained by a lack of homes, especially in the lower-priced segment of the market, because of land and labor shortages. That is keeping prices elevated. The median new house price rose 0.5 per cent to US$331,400 in December from a year ago. New home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, dropped 15.4 per cent in December to a rate of 347,000 units, the lowest since October 2018. Sales declined 11.8 per cent in the Northeast, but rose 10.1 per cent in the Midwest and surged 31.0 per cent in the West. There were 327,000 new homes on the market last month, up 1.6 per cent from November. At December's sales pace it would take 5.7 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.5 months in November. About two-thirds of new homes sold in December were either under construction or yet to be built.","summary":"WASHINGTON: Sales of new US single-family homes fell unexpectedly in December, likely held down by a shortage of more affordable homes, but lower mortgage rates supported the overall housing market.

Nancy Messonnier, head of respiratory diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said she was planning imminent changes on measures to control and track the deadly virus, beyond the current restrictions just on travellers arriving from Wuhan, which is at the epicentre of the outbreak. \"Right now, and based on CDC's analysis of the available data, it doesn't look like the [virus] has mutated,\" she said in a telephone news conference. \"All the sequences we've extracted are similar to the one that China initially posted a couple of weeks ago,\" she said. All passengers arriving from Wuhan are currently subject to testing in five US airports, but since China has suspended all flights out of the stricken city, there are fewer and fewer travellers from there arriving in the US. The virus has also reached other Chinese provinces and China has announced that people who are infected can spread the disease before they show any symptoms of fever or respiratory difficulties. That has rendered redundant the current measures to contain the virus in the US. \"I expect that in the coming days, our travel recommendations will change,\" said Messonnier. \"I expect there will be a decision, and an announcement about that within the next day.\" Despite that, the CDC still estimates the risk from the virus to Americans to be low. \"At this time in the US, this virus is not spreading in the community,\" Messonnier said. There have been five confirmed cases in the country and 110 patients have either been under observation or are currently being tested in 26 states. Aside from the five who so far tested positive, 32 have tested negative. It takes around a day to receive the test results from suspected cases because blood samples have to be sent to the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. The outbreak that began in Wuhan at the end of last year has killed at least 80 people and infected more than 2,700 in China. US President Donald Trump on Monday offered any help China needed to control the outbreak which has also left tens of millions stranded during the Chinese New Year, China's biggest holiday.

NEW YORK: The latest rally in U.S. stocks is facing a serious test, as the S&P 500 heads toward its worst loss in months on concerns over how the coronavirus will impact the global economy. So far, the selling has been measured, with most investors confident that the U.S. economy remains in good shape and the Federal Reserve stands ready to provide stimulus if the economic situation deteriorates. Still, worries have grown that months of placid trading may have left stocks primed for an upsurge of volatility. \"Markets hate uncertainty, and the coronavirus is the ultimate uncertainty,\" said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research, FTSE Russell, New York. \"With the markets overbought to begin with, this is now a sell first, ask questions later situation.\" The benchmark S&P 500  stock index has notched 71 days without a 1per cent move, the third such longest stretch since 1995. Past runs of quiet trading have tended to culminate in periods of turbulence: for instance, an unusually calm period from September 2017 to January 2018 preceded a sharp sell-off in U.S. stocks in February 2018, fueled by an implosion of bets that volatility would stay low. For an interactive graphic on S&P 500 moves, click here: http:\/\/fingfx.thomsonreuters.com\/gfx\/rngs\/GLOBAL-MARKETS-DASHBOARD\/010050DG0V9\/index.html On Monday, the Cboe Volatility Index  touched a three-month high and ended the session 3.67 points higher at 18.23 after having traded near its lowest levels over the past year earlier this month. The S&P 500 was on track for its biggest one-day percentage drop since October on Monday on news that the death toll from the virus grew in China and more cases were reported across the world. \"Positioning in the equity markets ... had gotten a little bit out of hand. That creates a lot of kindling for a fire in risk asset prices,\" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. There have been few tests to the bull market's most recent leg higher, which before Monday's losses has seen the S&P hit numerous fresh highs after the United States announced a trade deal with China in mid-December. Fears of a heightened conflict between the United States and Iran proved short-lived earlier this month, as did worries over delays in the signing of a trade agreement between Washington and Beijing in December. Growing confidence in the rally's durability had pushed investors to increase their exposure to equities: Allocations to global stocks stood at their highest level in 17 months, while cash levels have shrunk to a seven-year low, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers showed last week. Until last week, options also reflected muted concerns about a sharp pullback. Persistent low volatility would usually prompt greater demand for puts, which offer downside protection, in comparison to calls, used to participate in further upside, said Stacey Gilbert, portfolio manager for derivatives at Glenmede Investment Management in Philadelphia. But skew, a measure of interest in puts versus calls, for the S&P 500 rose only modestly in relation to the plunge in volatility. Investors could take comfort from the market's reaction to the 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak, when the S&P rallied more than 10per cent from the start of the outbreak to the announcement of its containment. Graphic: SARS timeline Image https:\/\/graphics.reuters.com\/USA-STOCKS\/0100B59736G\/sars-timeline.png A few investors have gone against the grain in recent weeks to purchase insurance against a jump in volatility while prices for most such bets have been relatively discounted. At least one investor earlier this month bought 225,000 calls that would require the VIX to hit 22 by late February in order to be redeemed. The index traded as high as 19.02 on Monday. \"People are nervous because the market has been going up for such a long time and done so well recently,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. \"I think this coronavirus may be more of an excuse than a rational estimate of its effects.\"","summary":"The latest rally in U.S. stocks is facing a serious test, as the S&P 500 heads toward its worst loss in months on concerns over how the coronavirus will impact the global economy.

Yang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease. Yang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. She has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time. \"My brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don't get any new answers,\" Zhang told Reuters. \"Every time the responses are the same: 'There's no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what's going on.' The doctors are all very frustrated too.\" Officially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan 10, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travellers from China for the virus within three days. However, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan's hospitals until about Jan 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters. Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities. During that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China. Despite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being \"rumour spreaders.\" \"The doctor didn\u2019t wear a mask, we didn\u2019t know how to protect ourselves ... no one told us anything,\" a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan 20, five days after she was hospitalised. \"I posted my aunt\u2019s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.\" National, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some \"loopholes\" in initial treatment methods. Wuhan's mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told Chinese state television on Monday he recognised that \"all parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information\". But he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders. \"In local governance, after I receive information, I can only release it when I'm authorised,\" he said. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested. China last week locked down the affected region in Hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. President Xi Jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak. The country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. However, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned. Once a virus has been identified, \"You need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you\u2019ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,\" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness. Although information from the region is scarce, Adalja suggested China has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. \"We\u2019re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,\" he said. John Edmunds, a professor at the centre for mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said China has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak. \"We have a very incomplete picture of what\u2019s going on,\" he told Reuters. \"Whether it\u2019s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, I don\u2019t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.\" The shortage of testing supplies and China's initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people. \"The improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus's genome, building new hospitals at a moment's notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,\" said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan's Center for Chinese Studies. City managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. The week in which no new virus cases were reported in Hubei coincided with preparations for Chinese New Year and sessions of the province's National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Seven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said. But four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials. To qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is \"impossible to conduct the test right away,\" an official at the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters. Three hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll. Wuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters. \"Some severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn't be able to be treated,\" the worker told Reuters. \"The actual deaths were higher.\" Reuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker's account. Hubei and Wuhan health authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Zhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three Wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus. However, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test. None of those hospitals replied to Reuters requests for comment. Sixty-nine-year-old Xu Enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since Jan 8, was rejected by six hospitals in Wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told Reuters. Xu's symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties. He was finally admitted on Jan 22 to queue for the test at Hankou hospital in Wuhan after his daughter publicised his case on Weibo. Researchers at Lancaster University estimate that only 5.1 per cent of infections in Wuhan have been identified. By Jan 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. More than 30,000 people in Wuhan are under observation, according to the city's health authorities. \"All we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,\" said a 33-year-old Wuhan woman surnamed Liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since Jan 14 and was still untested on Monday. \"At least if it's confirmed we have a direction. If there's no direction, there's no hope.\"","summary":"BEIJING: Yang Zhongyi was still waiting on Monday (Jan 27) for a coronavirus test in the Chinese city of Wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son Zhang Changchun told Reuters. Yang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease. \"Every time the responses are the same: 'There's no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what's going on.' The doctors are all very frustrated too.\" Officially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan 10, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. However, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan's hospitals until about Jan 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters. During that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China. They told me to take it down.\" National, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested. \"The improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus's genome, building new hospitals at a moment's notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,\" said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan's Center for Chinese Studies. Seven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said. But four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials. Three hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll. Wuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters.

As the death toll reached 81 and the virus spread to more than 10 countries, including France, Japan and the United States, some health experts questioned whether China can contain the epidemic. Beijing has already extended the Lunar New Year holiday to Feb. 2 nationally, and to Feb. 9 for Shanghai. On Tuesday, the country's largest steelmaking city in northern Hebei province, Tangshan, suspended all public transit in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.

Stocks on Wall Street fell more than 1per cent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500  held near three-week lows after slumping 1.6per cent overnight for their biggest single day percentage loss since last October. Analysts at JPMorgan said the coronavirus outbreak was an \"unexpected risk factor\" for markets though they see the contagion as a regional rather than a global shock. \"The rise in risk aversion and worry of a region-wide demand shock ... means the knee-jerk market reaction will likely be to richen low-yielding government bonds,\" JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note. \"Concerns about coronavirus contagion has driven yields lower and is the latest risk of a series that have driven US Treasuries (UST) yields far below what fundamentals indicate.

Yields on two-year paper  also fell sharply while Fed fund futures  rallied as investors priced in more risk of a rate cut later this year. Futures imply around 35 basis points of easing by year end . The Federal Reserve is widely expected to stand pat at its policy meeting this week, but markets will be sensitive to any changes to its economic outlook. JPMorgan said they have not yet altered their developed or emerging markets forex forecasts though they were taking profits on their \"bullish\" EUR\/USD positions and remain \"considerably long\" on Swiss francs which benefits from safe-haven demand. Short build-up in the Aussie was another risk hedge. In the currency market, the dollar index  added 0.1per cent to 97.948 led by safe-haven demand. The euro  was steady at US$1.1019.

LONDON: The world should be more anxious than it was a week ago. According to research published on Friday (Jan 24), a new SARS-like coronavirus has been present in China since Dec 1, a full month before the alarm was raised. Almost 3,000 people have been diagnosed with the respiratory illness. As of Monday afternoon, at least 35 cases were outside China. Eighty-two people have already died. Despite draconian quarantining, the virus, provisionally known as 2019-nCoV, is spreading. Several countries, including the UK, are considering evacuating nationals from the hot zone. It is now time for the World Health Organisation to call a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The revised timeline on when the virus began circulating comes courtesy of two papers in The Lancet medical journal, which reveal other worrying details. One sets out the clinical data on the first 41 laboratory-confirmed patients. Patient zero, who fell ill on Dec 1, had no link to the seafood market in Wuhan that is widely assumed to be the source of the outbreak. A further 13 of those 41 cases showed no link either. It is possible that the virus began circulating earlier than December. Other analyses separately suggest that containment is now a forlorn hope. The \u201creproduction number\u201d is thought to lie between two and four \u2014 meaning that, on average, each infected person passes the virus to between two and four others. That is high: Seasonal flu has a reproduction rate of about 1.4. The incubation period could be about a week, with infected individuals possibly being contagious while showing mild or no symptoms. Neil Ferguson, an Imperial College epidemiologist, estimated that 4,000 were infected by Jan 18. Jonathan Read, of Lancaster University, and colleagues provisionally calculate that the tally could exceed 190,000 by Feb 4. A \u201cgrave situation\u201d for China, as President Xi Jinping describes the epidemic, is a grave situation for the world. A fifth of the global population is now potentially exposed to a highly transmissible, currently incurable and potentially fatal respiratory virus. Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet, believes a PHEIC declaration should be considered. \u201cThe emergency committee [of the WHO] should reconvene as a matter of urgency,\u201d Mr Horton said, adding that he felt there were political sensitivities at play that have not dogged other epidemics, such as Ebola in west Africa. Recent developments, such as a special committee set up by China\u2019s ruling party, have also heightened rather than allayed his concerns. He says: \u201cNot one [of the people on that committee] has any background in public health. That makes me very worried.\u201d Mr Horton also fears the mass social unrest that may accompany prolonged quarantine with patchy information. It is unclear whether the WHO knew in advance of China\u2019s quarantine plans. The language emerging from its meetings has been painfully diplomatic, with its director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus remarking only that he hoped the extreme measures were \u201cboth effective and short in their duration\u201d. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said it was \u201cright and appropriate\u201d for China to control the first response. Antivirals were going into randomised trials on the ground, he said, and vaccines might become available within six months. He acknowledged, though, that the social consequences of quarantining millions of people remained \u201cuncharted territory\u201d. All factors considered, it is perverse to see the coronavirus outbreak as anything other than a PHEIC.

The virus, which can cause a pneumonia-like acute respiratory infection, has in a matter of weeks killed more than 100 people and infected at least 4,000 in China, while cases have been identified in more than a dozen other countries. In a fresh report on the new virus, known as 2019nCoV, the UN health agency said current estimates put the incubation period for the virus at between two and 10 days. \"Understanding the time when infected patients may transmit the virus to others is critical for control efforts,\" WHO said. It did not immediately confirm assertions made by Chinese authorities that people who are infected can spread the disease before they show any symptoms of fever or respiratory difficulties. \"Detailed epidemiological information from more people infected is needed to determine the infectious period of 2019nCoV, in particular whether transmission can occur from asymptomatic individuals or during the incubation period,\" it said. WHO last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern - a rare designation used only for the worst outbreaks that would trigger more concerted global action. But the world body admitted Monday it had made an error in its risk assessment for the deadly virus in several reports last week, acknowledging the global risk was \"high\" rather than \"moderate\". The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003 and was also traced to the wild game trade. The new virus is believed to have jumped to people from animals in a Wuhan market, but it has since begun spreading between humans, although the exact mode of transmission has yet to be confirmed. As with SARS and another deadly coronavirus known as Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, WHO suggested that the new virus could be spreading through droplets, for instance when people sneeze or cough, or through direct contact with infected people or with objects they have touched. To reduce the risk of infection, WHO stressed the need to avoid close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections, frequently wash one's hands, and avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. The agency also stressed the importance of practising so-called cough etiquette, including maintaining distance and covering coughs and sneezes with tissues. WHO has not recommended any international travel or trade restrictions, but does call for high levels of vigilance, including encouraging airport exit and entry screening for passengers leaving affected areas to check for fever and coughs.","summary":"GENEVA: The World Health Organization said Monday (Jan 27) it remained unclear if the deadly coronavirus spreading in China and beyond is contagious during its incubation period, before symptoms appear.

The deadly virus, which experts believe emanated from a wild animal market in the city of Wuhan last month, has triggered a desperate Chinese containment effort after spreading nationwide and to more than a dozen other countries. The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in central Hubei province, effectively trapping more than 50 million people, including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to contain the virus as the high-travel Chinese New Year holiday unfolds. As those trapped in Wuhan have become increasingly anxious, governments have scrambled to devise ways to safely get their citizens out of the city of 11 million. The United States, France and Japan are among those to have announced plans for airlifts, but nearly a week after the lockdown the evacuations have yet to happen. A chartered US-bound flight had been scheduled to leave Wuhan on Tuesday with consular staff and some American citizens. But the State Department said that had been postponed to Wednesday, without giving a reason. France has also said it intends to fly its citizens out of the city in the middle of this week, and Japan has similar plans. Several other countries also were working to repatriate their people, while Germany said it was considering doing so. Singapore authorities said they are working with China to bring home citizens stuck in Wuhan. On Monday, Singapore's Senior Minister of State for Transport Janil Puthucheary said officials are in touch with Singaporeans currently in the city and are exploring options for repatriation, including with airline companies. The virus can be transmitted between people, although scientists have yet to determine how contagious it is and exactly the way it is spread. In bids to stop huge numbers of people coming into close contact with each other, China has imposed tight transport restrictions in other parts of the country. It has extended the Chinese New Year national holiday into next week. The education ministry on Tuesday also said the spring semester for schools and universities nationwide would be postponed, without giving a resumption date. Despite the unprecedented measures, the virus has showed little sign of slowing down. The national health commission on Tuesday said 26 new deaths occurred in the preceding 24 hours, bringing the nationwide total to 106. Confirmed infections in China also jumped to 4,515, it said, up from 2,744 on Monday. There were nearly 7,000 more cases suspected and awaiting confirmation, according to the commission. The virus has also continued to spread around the world. On Monday, the first infections were confirmed in Germany, Canada and Sri Lanka. Fears over containment were heightened on Sunday when Wuhan's mayor, wearing a medical mask, revealed at a press conference that five million people had left the city for other parts of the country during the massive travel rush that precedes the New Year holiday. President Donald Trump said the United States has offered Beijing \"any help that is necessary\" in combatting the virus. But the United States, Turkey and Germany were among nations urging their citizens to \"reconsider\" all travel to China. Malaysia on Monday banned visitors arriving from Hubei. Landlocked Mongolia - which is heavily dependent on trade with China - took the drastic step of closing the border with its huge neighbour to cars. Mongolia also cancelled classes until Mar 2 and suspended large public gatherings. Medical facilities have been overwhelmed in Wuhan, which has become a near ghost-town. China has deployed hundreds of military medics to ease the pressure, and started building two hospitals with the aim of finishing them in just 10 days. AFP reporters saw hundreds of mask-wearing workers toiling around the clock to assemble one of the pre-fab field hospitals. Construction began just days ago but the outline of a floor was already taking shape and electrical switchboards were up on Monday. \"We have to work fast to combat the epidemic,\" a worker in his 30s, who refused to give his name, told AFP. Stressed Wuhan residents living under the quarantine expressed fears for the health and dwindling supplies at home. \"I'm getting more concerned every day,\" Do Quang Duy, a 32-year-old Vietnamese masters student in Wuhan, told AFP. But Wuhan's people, who have a reputation in China for resilience, sought to project a fighting spirit. Quarantined residents shouted \"Go Wuhan\" from their windows, according to videos posted online. A building lit up the night sky late on Monday with those words in red. The World Health Organization (WHO) last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted a more aggressive international response such as travel restrictions. But the WHO on Monday admitted making an error in originally assessing the virus' worldwide threat as \"moderate\", issuing an update late on Sunday to say the risk was actually \"high at the global level.\" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus travelled to Beijing this week for discussions with Chinese officials to coordinate on the crisis.","summary":"WUHAN, Hubei: The United States and other nations raced to get their citizens out of the locked-down Chinese city at ground-zero of a virus epidemic on Tuesday (Jan 28), as the death toll surged to 106 and the number of confirmed infections doubled to over 4,500. The deadly virus, which experts believe emanated from a wild animal market in the city of Wuhan last month, has triggered a desperate Chinese containment effort after spreading nationwide and to more than a dozen other countries. The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in central Hubei province, effectively trapping more than 50 million people, including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to contain the virus as the high-travel Chinese New Year holiday unfolds. France has also said it intends to fly its citizens out of the city in the middle of this week, and Japan has similar plans. Singapore authorities said they are working with China to bring home citizens stuck in Wuhan. On Monday, Singapore's Senior Minister of State for Transport Janil Puthucheary said officials are in touch with Singaporeans currently in the city and are exploring options for repatriation, including with airline companies. In bids to stop huge numbers of people coming into close contact with each other, China has imposed tight transport restrictions in other parts of the country. The national health commission on Tuesday said 26 new deaths occurred in the preceding 24 hours, bringing the nationwide total to 106. Confirmed infections in China also jumped to 4,515, it said, up from 2,744 on Monday.

Speaking to reporters after a visit to a My First Skool centre in Buangkok where he observed the implementation of additional steps which the pre-school had put in place, Mr Lee stressed the importance of such initiatives as well as the measures which the Government has already taken to help students and teachers. Among the steps implemented by the My First Skool centre is having temperatures taken for parents as they drop off their children. \"These are measures which are needed to ensure the well-being of our children and pre-school staff,\" he said. \"Yesterday we also announced (the implementation of) a leave of absence for children in pre-schools as well as pre-school staff who have visited China in the last 14 days and moving forward.\" He added: \"This is again a stepped-up precautionary measure because in pre-schools and these other social facilities we have more vulnerable communities like young children, elderly, persons with disabilities and so on. \"For parents, please be assured that we have robust measures in place; we are working closely with our pre-school operators.\" As of Jan 27, five cases of the Wuhan virus have been confirmed in Singapore. The deadly virus has killed at least 106 people in China so far, with more than 4,000 confirmed cases. My First Skool, which has more than 140 centres islandwide, has rolled out measures such as increased cleaning of facilities, as well as increased frequency of temperature taking to safeguard students and staff, said general manager Ms Thian Ai Ling. \"On a daily basis, we've always paid close attention to personal hygiene,\" said Ms Thian. \"Given the current situation, what we have stepped up is an additional layer of temperature taking as well as (during) multiple periods throughout the day, we are closely watching our children's well-being, ensuring that they do not show any symptoms. \"Should they do, we will contact parents immediately.\" When reporters visited a My First Skool centre at Buangkok on Tuesday, staff wearing surgical masks were observed taking the temperatures of parents and children upon their arrival outside the centre. The hands of parents and children were also sanitised before they entered the premises. In addition, staff members also made sure to check on the travel history of students and their parents, in the event that they did not complete a travel declaration which was sent last week. As a whole, further steps could be required down the road should the situation change, Mr Lee added. \u201cThe situation is fluid and evolving, the Government will look at the available information and evidence, look at the international guidelines and we may need to take further steps as the situation evolves,\u201d he said. For now, parents reporters spoke to said they were generally satisfied with the precautions taken at the centre at Buangkok. \"Even on normal days where there's a typical outbreak like hand,foot and mouth (disease), they would already have taken extra measures for that to ensure that the kids are safe,\" said Mr Lee Tai Yun, who was dropping off his 3-year-old daughter. \"So I'm pretty sure that this is just another day in their lives to try and control (the situation).\" However, there are also concerns that others might not have not been upfront about their travel history. \"Not only parents but relatives as well, as we do not know whether the (other) children might have relatives who came back from China.\" said Mdm Janani Rajendran. \"I was considering keeping my child at home because we don't know what are the odds.\" Another parent, Mr Zulfadli Abdullah, said that he had no qualms sending his son to the centre after the Chinese New Year holidays. \"Right now we have these measures in place, and if something were to happen, I would expect more measures.

He is part of a group of researchers that manages an online dashboard about the outbreak. Epidemiologists have no crystal ball. They have only piecemeal information on the new virus, which appeared in December. They use mathematical models to estimate the actual number of cases, as of the current date, and compare them to past outbreaks - but many of their hypotheses remain uncertain. Until the past weekend, researchers thought that infected people were not contagious until they began exhibiting symptoms, such as fever, respiratory problems, and pneumonia. But Chinese authorities said Sunday they had established the opposite. US health authorities said Monday they had not seen evidence that asymptomatic patients can infect other people. But if they can, this would definitely change the outbreak's dynamics. The first estimates for the length of the incubation period - about two weeks - are recent. In recent days, multiple experts have calculated an important parameter for any outbreak: The basic reproduction number, or \"R0\". It represents the number of people contaminated by an infected person. Estimates range from 1.4 to 3.8, according to Fisman, figures that are considered moderate. That is only an average: some patients may infect many people, while others infect only a few. \"On its own, it isn't a reason to panic,\" said Maimuna Majumder, a researcher at Harvard University and at Boston Children's Hospital. She said the rate is 1.3 for seasonal flu (which has millions of cases per year) and between two and five for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which resulted in 8,000 cases and 774 deaths, the majority in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. In comparison, the rate for measles ranges from 12 to 18. Quarantines and isolation measures, systematic hand washing and masks could help drive down the average number of infected people. If the rate falls below one, the epidemic will die down. But the effect of the control measures China has implemented won't be felt for another week or two, researchers say, based on the virus's cycle. \"The more we learn about it, the more it looks like SARS,\" said Fisman. \"SARS was controllable; hopefully this will be too. But we won't know for a few weeks.\" \"It's going to be many weeks, probably months, and nobody knows where this will go,\" he added. The official number of cases is more than 4,000 in China, with more than 100 deaths, and some 50 confirmed infections outside the country. But the actual number of Chinese cases, including those not yet detected, is likely to be more than 25,000, said Vespignani, according to the analysis of the group coordinated by Northeastern. And researchers at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) estimate that the number of actual cases has currently passed 40,000. \"It's easy to get to twice or three times as much, even just in the city of Wuhan,\" the virus's epicenter, said Vespignani. \"If we start to have other larger areas affected, then those numbers are going to be much, much bigger.\" He said he doesn't want to estimate the number of possible deaths. The mortality rate, until now, has hovered around three percent, but such rates have a tendency to fluctuate: they increase at the beginning as the most vulnerable patients die, then drop, and then rise again as others die. Again, only time will tell.","summary":"WASHINGTON: The deadly new coronavirus that has broken out in China, 2019-nCoV, will afflict a minimum of tens of thousands of people and will last at least several months, researchers estimate based on the first available data. \"It's not something that's going to end the next week or the next month,\" said Alessandro Vespignani, a professor at Northeastern University.

So far, all confirmed cases in Singapore are Chinese nationals from Hubei, similar to trends elsewhere, added MOH. The fact that 95 per cent of confirmed cases in Chinese cities were recently in Hubei also confirms that the infection has spread most widely in the province. While there is currently no evidence of community spread in Singapore, but this presents a \"heightened risk\" to Singapore, the ministry said.

After the United States and Canada warned against travel to China where the new coronavirus is thought to have originated, Australian stocks resumed trading sharply lower after a public holiday the previous day. The benchmark S&P\/ASX 200 index  fell 1.4per cent weighed by stocks exposed to the illness that has killed more than 100 people and infected more than 2,700. Shares of airlines and travel agents were sharply lower amid freezes on travel into and out of the world's second largest economy, while companies with an indirect exposure to Chinese consumer spending abroad, such as casinos and luxury retailers, also tumbled. \"We don't know how long it will go,\" said Peter Costello, chairman of Australia's US$115 billion sovereign wealth fund, the Future Fund, in a media briefing to coincide with a regular portfolio update. \"Obviously we hope that the measures that have been taken now will contain the virus but it's still far too early.

But with uncertainties still swirling over the severity and spread of the virus, it is too early to tell how big a hit the new infectious coronavirus could have on the overall Singapore economy this year, they told CNA. As of Tuesday (Jan 28), Singapore has confirmed seven cases of the China-originated virus. Speaking at a multi-agency press conference on Monday, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing warned that the outbreak will affect Singapore\u2019s economy, business and consumer confidence in 2020, with tourism-related sectors being of \u201cimmediate concern\u201d. CIMB Private Banking economist Song Seng Wun said this impact on tourism will likely start showing as soon as next month, particularly after authorities in China announced a halt of all group tours, both at home and to other countries, with effect from Monday. China is the biggest source of tourists to Singapore, accounting for nearly one fifth of total visitor arrivals, he said. Already, one travel agency has seen a flurry of cancellations by Chinese tour groups over the past few days. Dynasty Travel\u2019s director of public relations and communications Alicia Seah told CNA that its bookings from China for February have \u201call been cancelled\u201d. Mr Song said: \u201cThe latest measure will see visitor arrivals for February being affected and other frontline sectors, like retail and F&B (food and beverage), will also take some impact.\u201d \u201cThe longer this ban stays in place, the bigger the impact,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd if the developments over the next month prove to be not as favourable, then it won\u2019t just be the Chinese that are travelling less but across all nationalities. That will further impact the tourism-related sectors here.\u201d Ms Selena Ling, OCBC\u2019s head of treasury research and strategy, also told CNA that the tour cancellations, alongside some hit to business and economic confidence, in the wake of the Wuhan virus outbreak will likely \u201ccast a shadow\u201d over Singapore\u2019s economic growth momentum in the first quarter of 2020. In a bid to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, China has also rolled out other measures, such as extending the Chinese New Year holiday. The effect of this extended break on factory output, alongside lower consumer spending as people stay at home, will have a \u201csignificant hit\u201d on the Chinese economy for the first quarter, said economist Rajiv Biswas from IHS Markit. This weaker Chinese demand for imports of goods and services could have \u201cflow-on effects\u201d to Singapore\u2019s manufacturing sector, which exports raw materials, intermediate and finished goods to China, the chief economist for Asia-Pacific added. But beyond that, these three economists stressed that it is still too early to assess the full impact of the virus on the Singapore economy. Ms Ling said: \u201cThe key questions are how long this will last, whether it will get more severe from here and what control measures are taken that might disrupt productivity. \u201cWhile people seem to be looking to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) as a proxy, it is still too early to tell the full impact for now.\u201d Echoing that, Mr Biswas said the extent of the negative hit on Singapore\u2019s economic growth remains \u201chighly uncertain, depending on the speed with which the Wuhan virus epidemic is contained\u201d. Mr Song also noted that at the moment, consumer confidence in Singapore appears to be unaffected. \u201cThe thing to note is whether people are reassured by the immediate remedial measures that have been implemented. Compared with the SARS period where we were dealing with a virus outbreak for the first time, we\u2019ve since had Zika and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) and I think we are far better prepared in our preventive measures,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople seem to have gone on with their daily activities for now, though more are wearing masks. As long as people carry on with their daily lives, the impact on domestic activities won\u2019t be as severe.\u201d Nevertheless, economists noted that the outbreak coincides with a dip in overall exports and growth in Singapore\u2019s economy, suggesting less wiggle room should a worst case scenario happens. As such, Ms Ling said she is mulling a slash in the lower-end of her full-year growth estimate. \u201cWe were looking at 1 to 2 per cent for Singapore\u2019s economy in 2020, but we may adjust to 0 to 2 per cent to accommodate the potential downside risks,\u201d she said. Mr Chan on Monday had said that the Government will implement necessary measures to help businesses impacted by the Wuhan virus, as with previous episodes such as the SARS outbreak in 2003. These could include reducing business costs, alleviating cash flow problems and help to retain workers. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Government rolled out a S$230 million relief package to support the most adversely hit sectors. For the tourism-related industries, these included property tax rebates, reduction in foreign worker levy for unskilled workers, a bridging loan programme for small- and medium-sized enterprises to alleviate short-term cash-flow problems and enhanced training grants. The transport sector saw targeted measures such as diesel tax rebates for taxis and waivers of taxi operator license fees. Economists said it remains too early to speculate if the Government will release a relief package of a similar quantum this time round. They also had mixed views if help could come as early as the upcoming Budget in February. For instance, Mr Biswas thinks the upcoming Budget statement, which will be delivered on Feb 18 by Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, could include measures to assist the vulnerable tourism and travel sectors. On the other hand, Ms Ling reckoned that it is still early days into the virus outbreak and the Government could take a \u201cwait and watch\" approach. As of Tuesday, the death toll in China has jumped to 106 and the number of total confirmed cases up to 4,515, the country\u2019s authorities said. Across the world, confirmed cases have also been reported in Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam and the United States, heightening fears of the global economic impact of the new deadly virus. For Asia Pacific, the Wuhan coronavirus poses a \u201csignificant downside risk\u201d to region\u2019s economic outlook in the near term, if the epidemic continues to escalate in coming weeks, said Mr Biswas. \u201cThe extent and duration of this negative shock to regional economic growth will depend on how quickly the Wuhan virus epidemic can be brought under control, which remains very uncertain.\u201d Governments in Asia Pacific are likely to respond with a range of fiscal and monetary policy stimulus measures to prop up growth momentum in the near term. In particular, measures to help the tourism and travel sectors which are particularly vulnerable to this economic shock, he added.","summary":"SINGAPORE: The Wuhan virus outbreak is set to impact Singapore\u2019s tourism-related sectors in the coming months and possibly \u201ccast a shadow\u201d on economic growth for the first quarter, some economists said.

He apologised to the students affected and said that \"this is part of the national response\". \"We hope it won't happen, but should there be more contact tracing and confirmed cases, then we will need the facilities. So, it is better now before it happens that we get the facilities ready,\" he added.

SAN FRANCISCO: When Apple Inc posts quarterly results on Tuesday, investors will be looking for fresh evidence the iPhone maker should be treated as a producer of high-margin, subscription services after its stock market value touched US$1.4 trillion and its earnings multiple trades at decade highs. The Cupertino, California corporation's stock has doubled over the past year, even as iPhone sales contract along with the rest of the global smartphone market. Fueling its stellar run has been Chief Executive Tim Cook's push to turn Apple's loyal client base into a source of steady services revenue, including streaming video and a credit card launched last year with Goldman Sachs. Also supporting Apple's stock is excitement around an eventual pickup in iPhone demand with the rollout of 5G wireless technology, and low interest rates that have broadly helped Wall Street. Shares of Apple fell 2.9per cent on Monday from record highs as fears about the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak in China hit Wall Street. Analysts on Apple's quarterly earnings call after the bell on Tuesday will listen for comments concerning the impact on its manufacturing operations in China.Apple's market capitalization briefly exceeded US$1.4 trillion last Wednesday for the first time, but it has yet to end a session at that level. Some investors worry that Apple's rally, and surging earnings multiple, may have become overextended. \"The run-up in the stock is a concern, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see a bit of a pullback in the near future,\" said People's United Advisors chief equity strategist John Conlon, who added that Apple's services business has become his main reason for owning stock. Following its recent rally, Apple's stock is trading at the equivalent of 23 times expected earnings, its highest multiple since 2010, according to Refinitiv. Apple's average PE over the past decade was about 14, lagging other high-growth companies with recurring revenue and reflecting its singular dependence on iPhones sales and reliance on persuading consumers to upgrade their phones year after year. Salesforce.com and Netflix, which rely on recurring revenue, are trading at over 55 times expected earnings. Tech hardware sellers Intel and Cisco Systems are at about 14 times expected earnings. Apple is on track to reach a goal to double its 2016 services revenue to US$48.7 billion by the end of fiscal 2020 as it focuses on selling high-margin subscriptions to its user base. Many investors envision an increasingly rosy future for its earnings, a trend reflected in its soaring earnings multiple. Adding to existing services including cloud storage, the App Store and music, Apple last year launched an ambitious video streaming service, along with its credit card, a subscription news app and a videogame service. Apple has also increased the emphasis on its AppleCare, its extended warranty program. For example, the iPhone's \"settings\" now includes reminders encouraging people to buy or renew their AppleCare plans. In the September quarter, Apple said its services revenue hit US$12.51 billion, topping analysts expectations of US$12.15 billion. Services accounted for 20per cent of total revenue in that quarter, up from 17per cent in the same quarter the year before. Apple also gave cost of sales data showing gross margins for its services segment rose to 64per cent from a 61per cent a year earlier. That is far more generous than Apple's overall gross margin of around 38per cent in recent years. Still, for a business segment getting the most attention from Wall Street, Apple provides limited details. Apple's quarterly reports break out sales of iPhones, Macs and iPads, but a breakdown of results from products falling within the services category so far has not been released. Apple's recent strong stock performance has been perpetuated by fund managers buying its shares in order to avoid underperforming their benchmarks, a trend that could reverse when the recent rally ends, Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote in a client note last week. For the fiscal first quarter, which ended in December, analysts on average expect services revenue to jump 19.7per cent to US$13.0 billion, according to Refinitiv. Overall quarterly revenue is expected to rise 5.0per cent to US$88.5 billion, with adjusted net income inching up 1.5per cent to US$20.3 billion and earnings per share of US$4.55.","summary":"When Apple Inc posts quarterly results on Tuesday, investors will be looking for fresh evidence the iPhone maker should be treated as a producer of high-margin, subscription services after its stock market value touched US$1.4 trillion and its earnings multiple trades at decade highs.

LIVERPOOL: The World Health Organization\u2019s decision to not declare the novel coronavirus outbreak in China a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, will surprise many. The number of reported cases and deaths is doubling every couple of days, and patients have now been reported from many Asian countries, as well as the Middle East, Europe, Australia and the US. You might wonder how bad things have to get before this is deemed to be a global public health emergency. But such declarations by the WHO are not taken lightly, as Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) explained in the press conference. The concept of the WHO declaring global public health emergencies first arose after the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak. As with the current outbreak, it started in a live animal market where the spread of infected excrement to humans allowed the virus to cross the species barrier. But unlike the current situation, the SARS epidemic was growing for many months in China before authorities admitted they had a problem. By the time the SARS outbreak was brought under control, there were over 8,000 cases and 700 deaths in 37 countries. The WHO decided that declaring a PHEIC, introduced as part of the 2005 International Health Regulations, would help manage these situations. Previously, under legislation that was 150 years old, cholera, plague and yellow fever were contained by quarantine and embargoes at a country\u2019s borders. The 2005 legal framework focuses on containing an outbreak at its source, with an emphasis on preparedness. It requires countries to maintain necessary \u201ccore capacities\u201d, such as the ability to diagnose infections and isolate infected patients. And rather than only being able to report specific known diseases, they can report unusual public health patterns, for example an unexpected increase in patients with severe respiratory symptoms. A PHEIC is declared when there is \u201can extraordinary event which is determined \u2026 to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease\u201d. Such a declaration raises levels of international support, enhances diplomatic efforts and security, and makes more money available to support response teams. The reason for caution is that declaring a global public health emergency can unnecessarily affect trade and tourism and imply that a country cannot control the disease on its own. But given the Chinese response of quarantining 41 million people in 13 cities, this hardly seems like a consideration here. To date, there have been five such public health emergencies declared by WHO: the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, a 2014 declaration following the resurgence of wild poliovirus, the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic, the Zika emergency of 2015 to 2016, and, after much deliberation, the 2018-19 outbreak of Ebola in Kivu. As Tedros emphasised, even without the declaration of a PHEIC, there is already a coordinated international health response to the current coronavirus outbreak. And in some ways, this looks like a model public health response with concerted action underway. The Chinese have been quick to report the outbreak in Wuhan and share all the information they have. This early release of data has allowed modellers to predict that the total number infected is already probably in the thousands. Scientists in China rapidly sequenced the new virus to determine its genetic make-up. Their immediate publication of this information allowed others around the world to develop their own diagnostic tests. The Chinese authorities\u2019 quarantine moves underscore their determination to do everything they can to control the spread. Though whether it is possible to isolate so many people and whether at this stage it will help control the epidemic is uncertain. In the UK and other countries, passengers on flights coming directly from Wuhan were undergoing some health screening and being given information about what to do if they feel unwell. Such flights have now stopped, but these measures may need to be extended to flights from other parts of China. Several questions, however, remain unanswered, some of which will be key to the WHO\u2019s further deliberations on a PHEIC declaration over the next few weeks. It is clear that human-to-human transmission is happening \u2013 the infection has spread from patients to healthcare workers and other close contacts. What is not yet clear is how infectious the virus is. How much ongoing transmission will there be from the second patient to third, fourth and fifth contacts? And can people spread the virus before they even have symptoms? Scientists use the term reproductive rate to describe how easily a virus spreads, and the higher it is, the greater the chance of the outbreak spreading further and more quickly. The disease severity is also important. As of January 26, 56 (2.8 per cent) of 2,014 confirmed cases have died. For SARS, the case fatality rate was nearly 10 per cent. If the new coronavirus spreads rapidly but has a low case fatality rate, there will be less concern. Chinese scientists are conducting tests to determine which of the animals in the \u201cwet market\u201d in Wuhan might have been the source. There will also be questions about whether regulations to keep humans safe were being followed. After the 2003 outbreak, temporary rules were imposed to stop the sale of exotic animals, such as civet cats, which transmit SARS. But wet markets, which are usually crowded spaces selling live poultry and other animals, are popular with shoppers in Asia. About 600 people die in the UK every year from flu alone, and around the world there are hundreds of thousands of deaths. So while the emergence of a new virus will always cause alarm, the current response of public health officials and scientists in China and around the world, which incorporates everything we have learnt since SARS, should reassure the public, regardless of whether or not the WHO eventually declare this a global public health emergency. Tom Solomon is Director of the National Institute for Health Research, Health Protection Research Unit in Emerging and Zoonotic Infections, and Professor of Neurology, Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool.

Xi made his remarks during talks with head of the World Health Organization in Beijing as a host of nations prepared to airlift their citizens from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. \"Chinese people are currently engaged in a serious struggle against an epidemic of a new type of coronavirus infection,\" Xi told WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"The epidemic is a demon, and we cannot let this demon hide,\" the Chinese leader said, pledging that the government would be transparent and release information on the virus in a \"timely\" manner. His comments came after anger simmered on Chinese social media over the handling of the health emergency by local officials in central Hubei province, where the disease first emerged in December. Some experts have praised Beijing for being more reactive and open about this virus compared to its handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-2003. But others say local cadres had earlier been more focused on projecting stability than responding to the outbreak when it began to spread earlier this month. Since then, the number of cases has soared - doubling to more than 4,500 in the past 24 hours. WHO chief Tedros praised China's response to the crisis during a meeting with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, according to state news agency Xinhua. The WHO last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted a more aggressive international response such as travel restrictions. But global concern has been growing, with Japan and Germany on Tuesday reporting the first human-to-human infections outside China. Until now, all cases in more than a dozen countries involved people who had been in or around Wuhan. In Japan, a man in his sixties contracted the virus apparently after driving two groups of tourists from the city earlier in January, the health ministry said. He was hospitalised with flu-like symptoms on Saturday. On the other side of the world, a 33-year-old German man caught the disease off a Chinese colleague from Shanghai who visited Germany last week, according to health officials. The development came after countries including Sri Lanka, Malaysia and the Philippines announced tighter visa restrictions for people coming from China. Experts believe the virus came from a wild animal market in Wuhan and then jumped to humans, with Chinese health officials saying Tuesday that people infect each other through sneezing or coughing, and possibly through contact. Authorities initially sealed off Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province late last week, trapping more than 50 million people. China then halted international and domestic group tours. It also imposed a wide range of travel restrictions inside China, suspending long-distance bus routes and more than 2,000 train services. But with the death toll climbing and more fatalities reported in Chinese cities far away from Wuhan, authorities on Tuesday urged people to delay any foreign travel \"to protect the health and safety of Chinese and foreign people\", the National Immigration Administration said. Wuhan, meanwhile, has been turned into a near ghost-town under a lockdown that has largely confined the industrial hub's 11 million people to their homes. With a ban on car traffic, the streets were nearly deserted apart from the occasional ambulance - although the city's hospitals are overwhelmed. \"Everyone goes out wearing masks and they are worried about the infection,\" said David, a Chinese man who works in Shanghai but ended up trapped in Wuhan after it was put under quarantine. Many thousands of foreigners are also among those stuck in the city. \"It's deeply stressful,\" Joseph Pacey, a 31-year-old Briton who teaches English in Wuhan, told AFP. \"The biggest fear for me is that this thing will go on for months, and it will get harder and harder to get supplies, and to live.\" Japan said it would send a chartered flight on Tuesday evening to get about a third of its 650 nationals there. \"We will also bring aid supplies such as masks and protective suits for Chinese people as well as for Japanese nationals,\" Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said in Tokyo. If the mission succeeds, Japan would be the first country to airlift its citizens out of Wuhan. A US-chartered flight bound for California is scheduled to leave Wuhan on Wednesday with consular staff and some American citizens, a day later than previously planned. France and South Korea are also planning to fly out their citizens later this week, and several other countries, including Germany, were considering doing the same. The United States, Turkey and Germany have urged their citizens to \"reconsider\" all travel to China. Landlocked Mongolia - which is heavily dependent on trade with China - took the drastic step of closing the border with its huge neighbour to cars, as well as shutting down schools and banning large gatherings.

All of the more than 100 deaths from the virus have been in China, centred on Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Centre said the latest patient, the eighth, was the first case of transmission on the island as in all the previous cases the people had been infected first in China. The new patient, a man in his 50s from central Taiwan, was infected by his wife after she returned from working in China and before she was subsequently diagnosed, the command centre said. The man is in a stable condition, it said. Separately, the command centre said it would extend to the rest of China an earlier warning not to go to Hubei province unless totally necessary, though Hong Kong and Macau are excluded. Taiwan has also restricted the vast majority of Chinese visitors. Last week, Taiwan's government announced a one month ban on the export of specialist masks designed to be used for medical personnel, saying it had to look after the needs of its own people first. Some pharmacies in Taiwan have said they face shortages of face masks.

The US government is keen to place its own teams on the ground to review the raw data and learn more about the pathogen, which has so far claimed more than 100 lives. \"We have already started at the NIH and with many of our collaborators on the developing of a vaccine,\" National Institutes for Health (NIH) official Anthony Fauci told reporters. The process would take three months to start the first trial, three more months to gather data, before being able to move into its second phase. \"But we are proceeding as if we will have to deploy a vaccine,\" said Fauci. \"In other words, we're looking at the worst scenario that this becomes a bigger outbreak.\" China was severely criticised for its handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-03, which claimed hundreds of lives, mostly on the mainland and in Hong Kong. During that health emergency, scientists had begun to develop a vaccine, but it was never deployed, Fauci said. Separately, the chief scientific officer of Johnson & Johnson told AFP that his company was also developing a vaccine. \"We will utilise the same technology that was used in the development and manufacture of Johnson & Johnson's Ebola vaccine which is currently deployed in DRC and Rwanda,\" said Paul Stofells. It is \"the same technology was also used to construct our Zika and HIV vaccine candidates\". US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the United States has offered China assistance three times in dealing with the crisis - so far without success. This would be necessary so that \"we can see raw data, raw evidence and help design the types of studies and analytics\" to answer critical questions such as incubation period and whether the infection can be transmitted while patients don't have symptoms. \"We are urging China - more cooperation and transparency are the most important steps you can take toward a more effective response,\" Azar told reporters. \"On Jan 6, we offered to send a CDC team to China that could assist with these public health efforts,\" said Azar. \"I reiterated that offer when I spoke to China's minister of health on Monday, and it was reiterated again via the World Health Organization's leadership today in Beijing.\" China was quick to sequence the genome of the 2019 novel coronavirus and make it public, allowing scientists around the world to develop diagnostic tools and winning praise for its efforts, including from US President Donald Trump. Just four days ago, Trump tweeted: \"China has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency.\" But the new revelation by Azar raises questions about how much China has truly cooperated. \"CDC experts are standing by ready, willing and able to go immediately to China, either on a bilateral basis or under the auspices of the World Health Organization,\" Azar said.

More than 50 million people have been locked down in and around Wuhan, the central industrial city where the outbreak first began, in a bid by authorities to stop an infection that has since spread to more than 15 countries. Thousands of foreigners are among those effectively trapped in the area, and numerous countries are devising plans to get their nationals out. Chinese President Xi Jinping called the virus a \"demon\" during talks on Tuesday with the head of the World Health Organisation in Beijing, and pledged a \"timely\" release of updates about the crisis. But the United States questioned Beijing's transparency and urged the country to show \"more cooperation,\" amid mounting global fears about a novel coronavirus that has infected more than 4,500 people in China and dozens more elsewhere. Figures from Hubei province on Wednesday morning showed the number of cases in the city had soared by over 800 in the past 24 hours, with another 25 deaths confirmed at the epicentre of the contagion. A further death was reported outside Hubei, taking the nationwide death toll to 132. The number of confirmed cases across the country stood at nearly 6,000. As concern about the outbreak continued to mount, a plane carrying around 200 Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan landed in Tokyo on Wednesday morning. Medical professionals on board the flight were expected to carry out health checks before the passengers could disembark but there were no plans to quarantine them. Around 650 Japanese nationals in the Wuhan area had said they wanted to be repatriated and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Tokyo would take \"every possible measure\" to bring them home. A US charter flight also left the city on Wednesday with about two hundred American citizens onboard including staffers from the local US consulate. \"These travellers will be carefully screened and monitored to protect their health, as well as the health and safety of their fellow Americans,\" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said. The European Union will fly its citizens out aboard two French planes this week, and South Korea was due to do the same. Several other countries were assessing their options. Several countries, most recently Australia, have urged their citizens to \"reconsider\" all travel to China. Chinese President Xi Jinping said his country was waging a \"serious struggle\" against the \"demon\" epidemic during talks with WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in Beijing on Tuesday. China has extended its Chinese New Year holiday to keep people indoors as much as possible, and suspended a wide range of train services. Following the Xi-Tedros talks, the WHO said the two sides had agreed to send international experts to China \"as soon as possible ... to guide global response efforts.\" \"Stopping the spread of this virus both in China and globally is WHO's highest priority,\" Tedros said. Until Tuesday, all reported cases in more than a dozen countries had involved people who had been in or around Wuhan, but Japan and Germany have reported the first human-to-human infections outside China. Some experts have praised Beijing for being more reactive and open about this virus compared to its handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-2003. But others say local cadres had earlier been more focused on projecting stability than responding to the outbreak when it began to spread earlier this month. Since then, the number of cases has soared - doubling to more than 4,500 in the 24 hours to Tuesday. The United States said on Tuesday it was working on a vaccine - but that it would take months to develop.

Apple on Tuesday (Jan 28) reported sales and profits for the holiday shopping quarter above Wall Street expectations, powered by a rise in iPhone sales for the first time in a year and soaring demand for add-ons like AirPods wireless headphones. The strong performance outweighed concern about the coronavirus in China, a major market as well as manufacturing hub for Apple, and a slight revenue miss in the company's closely watched services business, which includes the new Apple TV+ streaming offering. Shares of Apple rose 2 per cent in after-hours trade. Apple gave a revenue forecast for the quarter ending in March above Wall Street expectations. Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters the company was using a wider-than-normal prediction range because of the uncertainty created by the coronavirus outbreak in China. Cook said Apple has shut one store in China and reduced hours at others and is restricting employee travel due to the virus. \"We have limited travel to business-critical situations as of last week,\" he said. \"The situation is emerging and we\u2019re still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely.\" Apple has suppliers in the Wuhan area, the heart of the outbreak, but has alternatives, Cook said. He said that factories outside Wuhan area also faced delayed reopenings after the Chinese New Year holiday until Feb 10, but that Apple has tried to account for the delayed restart of work in its wider revenue forecast. In terms of consumer demand within China for Apple's products, Cook said Apple is seeing reduced foot traffic in its stores there. It has reduced hours at some stores and is also checking the temperatures of employees. Cook also said that Apple's channel partners - third-party stores that sell its products - are also facing some closures. \"Apple also is forecasting a stronger Q2 than analysts predicted, but the fact that the coronavirus is spreading in unpredictable ways in China, where Apple has most of its hardware built, could upset this optimistic forecast,\" said eMarketer principal analyst Yoram Wurmser. The number of active iPhones, computers and other devices owned by customers, called the installed base, grew by 100 million to more than 1.5 billion over the past year, and Apple executives set a new target of 600 million paid subscribers for music, TV, gaming and other services by the end of calendar 2020. Apple\u2019s share price has more than doubled since Cook warned a year ago that the company was likely to miss financial targets for its biggest sales quarter of its fiscal 2019. In the year since, Apple slashed prices in China, one of its most important markets, to rekindle sales there. The company also made a push into paid services, rolling out a credit card with Goldman Sachs and subscription gaming and television services last year. \"Services are important, but the trajectory is heading on target. I feel they\u2019ve made good progress on that front,\" said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel. \"It\u2019s easier to take a small miss like that in context when they also lift the Q2 revenue figures higher.\" Apple posted US$91.8 billion in revenue for the quarter ended Dec 28, compared with analyst estimates of US$88.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company forecast US$63.0 billion to US$67.0 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, ahead of estimates of US$62.4 billion, showing it believes that its phones and other devices such as AirPods wireless headphones will continue to sell well during what is often a slow time of year. Apple reported services revenue of US$12.7 billion, below analyst estimates of US$13 billion, and up from US$10.9 billion the year before. Many investors think that services revenue eventually will boost Apple\u2019s gross margins, which were 38.35 per cent in the December quarter compared with estimates of 38.06 per cent. The shift toward services, however, depends on Apple continuing to grow its base of users and sign them up for recurring subscriptions that analysts view as potentially more lucrative than hardware sales, which can be inconsistent because they are large purchases that consumers make only every few years. Apple said it now has more than 1.5 billion active installed devices and 480 million subscribers to both its own and third-party paid services, compared with 1.4 billion devices and 360 million subscribers a year earlier. Cook said the company's Apple TV+ subscription streaming video service released last fall was a \"rousing success\" and that it is \"very strong, both the people that are getting it in the bundle and the people that are paying for it that haven't bought a new device\". Solid iPhone sales of US$55.96 billion compared with analyst estimates of US$51.6 billion and year-before sales of US$52 billion snapped a yearlong trend of major sales declines for Apple\u2019s biggest-selling hardware product. Cook said that the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models drove the growth and also factored into the company's forecast, calling the devices \"the strongest iPhone lineup we've ever had.\" But Apple\u2019s wearables segment \u2013 which, along with AirPods, also includes the Apple Watch \u2013 hit US$10.0 billion in revenue versus estimates of US$9.5 billion, up sharply from US$7.3 billion the year before. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients that sales of AirPods alone \u2013 a metric Apple does not disclose \u2013 may have reached US$3.5 billion to US$4 billion in the December quarter, a rise of 150 per cent from the year before. Cook told Reuters that Apple could not make enough AirPods and Apple Watch Series 3 devices to meet demand during the fiscal first quarter and continues to be short on both. Cook said Apple does not have an estimate for when it will be able to fulfill demand for each. \"We're working on both of those very hard,\" Cook told Reuters. For the December quarter, Apple reported earnings per share of US$4.99, compared with analyst estimates of US$4.55 per share. For the quarter ending in March, Apple forecast gross margins of between 38.0 per cent and 39.0 per cent, compared with analyst estimates of 38.2 per cent.","summary":"Apple on Tuesday (Jan 28) reported sales and profits for the holiday shopping quarter above Wall Street expectations, powered by a rise in iPhone sales for the first time in a year and soaring demand for add-ons like AirPods wireless headphones.

SINGAPORE: SARS was a very real experience for me. I\u2019ll never forget the sight of two men in scrubs, caps, gloves and masks arriving at our doorstep, after my mother called 995 when my fever and cough would not break despite days of flu medication. It was 2003. Singapore was in the throes of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The sight that greeted me at Tan Tock Seng Hospital made fear of\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b the virus very real. Dozens of beds were laid around the A&E ward, which had been turned into an emergency site to deal with the challenge. A lot was happening. Medical professionals were busy drawing blood and taking people\u2019s vitals. Nurses were following up with patients and ensuring those free from the virus left the place promptly. Frozen in dread to the bed I was assigned, I looked awkwardly at many other patients who gave faint smiles, all of us thinking to ourselves some may have to face a life-threatening fight soon and might not live to tell it. SARS arrived on Singapore shores like a silent killer in the night. Although the first case broke in China in November 2002, the World Health Organization (WHO) only issued an alert in March 2003. It was unclear at first what the virus was, how bad it was and how long the crisis would grip Singapore. Face masks and common cold medication were wiped off shelves. People started to stay away from public spaces, including hawker centres, malls and mass events, and shunned healthcare workers. Questions were also raised about whether our healthcare systems were up to scratch in dealing with the threat. With Singapore confirming its seventh case of the Wuhan virus on Tuesday (Jan 28), such scenes may have played out in the minds of concerned Singaporeans reading the news. Many online have expressed concerns over the virus\u2019 spread and anxiety that the situation could get worse. Rumours and misinformation are a risk. A general correction order was issued to SPH Magazines for a Hardware Zone post falsely alleging a man had died from the Wuhan virus in Singapore. But while fear may have been the memory of SARS that many Singaporeans have, what comes to my mind instead is how decisively control was wrestled back. A Ministerial Committee chaired by then Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng was established to drive the national response. Strong action was taken. Home quarantine was imposed under the Infectious Disease Act, and schools were closed for almost two weeks. To stem the spread, screening protocols were ramped up in most public places. Contact tracing was instituted and hourly temperature-taking became the norm. An intensive public education campaign was also mounted. Tool kits were distributed to Singapore households. Singaporeans understood the need for such actions to mitigate the risk and strongly supported these moves. The SARS outbreak also brought forth a strong level of regional and global cooperation. Despite the disparaging vitriol over China\u2019s initial slow reaction, governments in affected countries pulled out all stops to curb the spread. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) met in an emergency summit, initiated by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, where a joint plan of action was agreed upon, including recommendations to standardise health declaration cards, temperature screening and information-sharing. The WHO was enlisted to deploy consultants and field teams in support of national responses, including investigations of a super spreader hospitalised in Singapore in March that year. It set up a virtual network of public health institutions, health ministries and WHO country offices to exchange case experiences and findings that built up a comprehensive surveillance picture. And it established case definitions and standards for global reporting, and published daily situational updates to enhance the flow of information. Such activities helped to catalyse a thoughtful and concerted overall international response and developed standards and best practices in infection control and risk mitigation. With the unprecedented level of international cooperation and strong action from governments, SARS was contained in a matter of months, despite the fact no vaccine or cure was ever developed. The WHO declared Singapore SARS free on May 30, 2003. The relief in the air was palpable. Speaking in Davos last Thursday (Jan 24), Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong urged Singaporeans to be calm but watchful, adding that the Government is well-prepared to deal with the new coronavirus. PM Lee pointed to the establishment of a multi-ministry task force co-chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong. Numerous plans to curb the risk of spread have since been stood up, including the set-up of quarantine facilities, increased border checks and a compulsory leave of absence for students and teachers from China, announced by the multi-ministry task force on Monday. Public health capabilities in dealing with infectious diseases here have also since been enhanced after 2003. A new National Centre for Infectious Disease has replaced the decades-old Communicable Disease Centre. Academics from the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health are also enlisted in epidemiological research today. Back to 2003. After blood tests and close observation, I was sent home with a somewhat clean bill of health: No SARS, just an incredibly strong bout of the flu. To be sure, I was more fortunate than the over 200 Singaporeans who contracted the virus and the dozens who lost their lives, which include five healthcare workers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Thinking back, what I was most grateful for was the kampung spirit and sense of togetherness the episode brought out. For days while I rested at home, concerned neighbours unsure of whether contact was really still safe nonetheless popped by and left gifts of homemade soups and fruits with my mother. Singapore has to be prepared that the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak could be worse than the SARS epidemic in 2003, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said on Monday. \u201cBe psychologically prepared that this may take some time to unravel, but be assured too that you have a system in place,\u201d he said, citing the inter-ministry coordination mechanisms and drawer plans in place for a full range of different scenarios of the virus outbreak. Today, as fears of the Wuhan virus grow, many Singaporeans might recall 2003, the year SARS had Singapore in its grip. But while that period has generally been framed as a cautionary tale of how pandemics can threaten societies, what comes to my mind is a more optimistic picture. It was a time of international cooperation - when international collaboration and multilateral organisations played an important role in solving a transboundary challenge, and countries around the world exercised political will to bring the problem under control. It was also a time when the Singapore Government bolstered public confidence in national institutions and Singaporeans were cautious but did not let the threat stop them from rallying together.

Public health capabilities in dealing with infectious diseases here have also since been enhanced after 2003. Academics from the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health are also enlisted in epidemiological research today. After blood tests and close observation, I was sent home with a somewhat clean bill of health: No SARS, just an incredibly strong bout of the flu. To be sure, I was more fortunate than the over 200 Singaporeans who contracted the virus and the dozens who lost their lives, which include five healthcare workers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Singapore has to be prepared that the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak could be worse than the SARS epidemic in 2003, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said on Monday. Today, as fears of the Wuhan virus grow, many Singaporeans might recall 2003, the year SARS had Singapore in its grip. It was also a time when the Singapore Government bolstered public confidence in national institutions and Singaporeans were cautious but did not let the threat stop them from rallying together.","datetime":1580279160000,"date_time":1580298355000},{"title":"US stocks bounce back after virus-fuelled rout","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/business\/us-stocks-bounce-back-after-virus-fuelled-rout-12363708","article":"NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks rebounded on Tuesday (Jan 28) following solid US economic data and mixed earnings as markets kept a watchful eye on developments in the China virus outbreak. Authorities remained fixated on the SARS-like virus, which has already killed 106 people in China and spread to around 15 countries, but investors pivoted from Monday's rout, apparently concluding the pullback was a buying opportunity. There \"some optimism that's crept into the market that maybe this coronavirus won't spread enough out of control to really create a major epidemic crisis,\" said LBBW's Karl Haeling. One sign of the optimism was strong gains for several travel-oriented stocks, including Marriott International and Wynn Resorts. The latter operates resorts in gambling center Macau, where there have been confirmed virus cases. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 187.05 points (0.66 per cent) at 28,722.85. The broad-based S&P 500 gained 32.61 points (1.01 per cent) to 3,276.24, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 130.37 points (1.43 per cent) to 9,269.68. US consumer confidence jumped more than expected in January, according to the Conference Board. Meanwhile, orders of durable goods in December topped expectations, though some analysts pointed to weakness in the underlying data suggesting vulnerabilities in business investing. Pfizer slumped 5.1 per cent as it reported a US$337 million loss in the fourth quarter on lower sales. Fellow Dow member 3M sank 5.7 per cent as it announced it was cutting 1,500 jobs and took a charge of US$134 million in restructuring expenses. Net income in the fourth quarter fell 28.1 per cent to US$969 million. Among others reporting results, United Technologies gained 1.2 per cent, Lockheed Martin won 1.1 per cent and Harley-Davidson dropped 2.6 per cent.

For now, however, the longest economic expansion on record looks set to continue, with other data on Tuesday (Jan 28) showing consumer confidence surged to a five-month high in January amid optimism over the labour market. That suggests consumer spending could stay fairly strong in the near term and blunt some of the hit on the economy from weak business investment. Business spending has remained weak even as the Federal Reserve cut interest rate cuts three times last year. Officials from the US central bank started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. They are expected to reiterate the Fed's desire to keep rates unchanged at least through this year. Weak business investment and the resulting slump in manufacturing have been on the radar of Fed officials who have blamed trade tensions, especially the White House's 18-month trade war with China, and an uncertain global economic growth outlook for the malaise. Though tensions have eased with the signing this month of a \"Phase 1\" trade deal between Washington and Beijing, Boeing continues to loom over manufacturing. Boeing this month suspended production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, which was grounded last March following two fatal crashes. \"Manufacturing is clearly losing momentum as many of the most extreme tariffs on supply-chain inputs factories need to produce their final goods remain in place,\" said Chris Rupkey chief economist at MUFG in New York. \"When it comes to forecasting the economy in 2020, it's the consumer stupid.\" The Commerce Department said orders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely-watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 0.9 per cent last month as demand for machinery, primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components declined. That was the largest decrease since April. Data for November was revised lower to show these so-called core capital goods orders edging up 0.1 per cent instead of gaining 0.2 per cent as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods would be unchanged in December. Core capital goods orders rose 0.8 per cent in 2019. Shipments of core capital goods decreased 0.4 per cent last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They declined by an unrevised 0.3 per cent in November. Business investment has contracted for two straight quarters and was likely stuck in the red in the fourth quarter. The latest data also suggest a recovery is unlikely soon. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP to rise at a 1.9 per cent annualised rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1 per cent rate in the July-September period. The government will publish its snapshot of fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday. In a separate report on Tuesday, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index increased 3.4 points to a reading of 131.6 in January, the highest reading since August. Economists expected a temporary drop in consumer confidence in February because of the deadly coronavirus, which has killed more than 100 people in China, with cases reported in some countries including the United States, France and Japan. The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, increased to 37.4 this month from 33.5 in December. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labour Department's employment report. Though the labor market remains strong, there are signs that momentum is slowing. Job growth cooled in December and vacancies recorded their biggest drop in more than four years in November. \"The good news is that a drop in confidence is unlikely by itself to cause a significant drop in consumer spending,\" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies as concerns about the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak boosted demand for safe-haven currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, while US Treasury prices fell. The US-China trade war has hurt business confidence, undercutting capital expenditure and pushing manufacturing, which accounts for 11 per cent of the economy, into recession. Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years is expected to wreak havoc with the supply chain. The plane maker's largest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, announced early this month that it planned to lay off more than 20 per cent of the workforce at its Wichita, Kansas base. Economists estimate the production suspension could slice at least half a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth. The hit to GDP growth would come from a smaller inventory build. Though airlines have continued to submit orders there have been no deliveries, leading to a rise in inventories at factories. In December, overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, rebounded 2.4 per cent after tumbling 3.1 per cent in the prior month. They were boosted by a 7.6 per cent surge in orders for transportation equipment, the largest increase since August 2018, which followed an 8.3 per cent drop in November. Orders for defence aircraft and parts soared 168.3 per cent last month, offsetting a 74.7 per cent plunge in demand for civilian aircraft. Boeing reported on its website that it had received only three commercial aircraft orders in December, down from 63 in November. December is normally a strong month for aircraft orders. Motor vehicles and parts orders fell 0.9 per cent in December. \"Business spending is set to remain weak in the coming quarters,\" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.","summary":"WASHINGTON: New orders for key US-made capital goods dropped by the most in eight months in December and shipments were weak, suggesting business investment contracted further in the fourth quarter and remained a drag on economic growth.

All seven cases involve Chinese nationals, the country's Health Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah said on Tuesday (Jan 28). The new cases include a four-year-old child, a 52-year-old man and the mother of two previously confirmed cases. The child is being treated at a hospital in Langkawi, while the man is being treated at a hospital in Johor Bahru. Authorities said the mother had initially tested negative and had stayed in Malaysia to take care of her children - grandsons of a 66-year-old man who tested positive in Singapore for the coronavirus last week. The authorities are still waiting for the lab results of one case, said Dr Noor Hisham. Malaysia's health ministry has always ensured that preparedness and response towards a disease outbreak would be implemented quickly and efficiently, he said, adding that existing capabilities are being enhanced to tackle the coronavirus infections. Separately, Malaysia's communications regulator said it has detained one person accused of spreading fake news on the coronavirus. The person was arrested over a Facebook post that contained false information on the outbreak, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission said. The virus, which first started in the city of Wuhan in China's Hubei province, has since spread to more than 10 other areas including as far afield as the United States, France and Australia. Malaysia has stepped up screening checks at all entry points into the country and temporarily suspended the granting of visas for all residents from China's Hubei province.

The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China stands at 5,974, the authority said in a statement. The health body said they were also monitoring more than 9,000 suspected cases of the virus. The spike in numbers comes even as Beijing reiterated its confidence in containing the disease. Fears of the spreading virus led airlines to reduce flights to China and global companies to restrict employee travel to the country. CNBC reported that the White House had told US airlines it may suspend all China-US flights due to the outbreak. The new figures came as Japan airlifted about 200 of its nationals out of the city, and the US evacuated about 240 Americans by air. More than 50 million people have been locked down in and around Wuhan, the central industrial city where the outbreak first began, in a bid by authorities to stop an infection that has since spread to other cities in China and to other countries. The flu-like virus has spread overseas to more than a dozen countries. None of the confirmed deaths to date has been outside China. However, confirmations of person-to-person transmission in Germany, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan - as opposed to a traveller from China - has heightened concern. Known as 2019-nCoV, the newly identified coronavirus can cause pneumonia and, like other respiratory infections, it spreads between people in droplets from coughs and sneezes. It is too early to know what its death rate will be, since there are likely to be many cases of milder disease going undetected. \"The virus is a devil and we cannot let the devil hide,\" state television quoted Chinese President Xi Jinping said during a meeting with World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in Beijing on Tuesday. \"China will strengthen international cooperation and welcomes the WHO participation in virus prevention ... China is confident of winning the battle against the virus.\" China's assurances failed to calm investors, however, as and health authorities around the world continued to step up efforts to stop the virus from spreading on their shores. The United States said it was expanding screening of arrivals from China from five to 20 airports and would consider imposing further travel curbs. \"All options for dealing with infectious disease spread have to be on the table, including travel restrictions,\" said US Health Secretary Alex Azar. From France to Japan, governments were organising evacuations, while Hong Kong - scene of anti-China unrest for months - planned to suspend rail and ferry links with the mainland. United Airlines said it was suspending some flights between the United States and China for a week from Feb 1 due to a \"significant decline in demand\".

But Apple is girding for more disruptions in virus-hit China. REUTERS: The iPhone is back. But Apple is girding for more disruptions in virus-hit China. Apple Inc  on Tuesday reported sales and profits for the holiday shopping quarter above Wall Street expectations, thanks to rising iPhone sales for the first time in a year and soaring demand for add-ons like AirPods wireless headphones. The performance outweighed concerns about the coronavirus outbreak in China, a major market and manufacturing hub for Apple, and a slight revenue miss in the company's services business, which includes the new Apple TV+ streaming offering. Shares of Apple rose 2per cent in after-hours trade. Apple forecasted revenue for the quarter ending in March above Wall Street expectations. Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters the company used a wider-than-normal prediction range because of the uncertainty created by the coronavirus. \"We have limited travel to business-critical situations as of last week,\" he said. \"The situation is emerging, and we\u2019re still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely.\" Apple has suppliers in the Wuhan area, the heart of the outbreak, but has alternatives, Cook said. Factories outside Wuhan area will not reopen after the Lunar New Year holiday until Feb. 10, Cook said, but Apple built the delayed restart into its wider revenue forecast. Apple has shut one store in China, he said, and reduced hours at others because of lower foot traffic, Cook said. Third-party stores that sell Apple products are also facing some closures, Cook said. Apple is \"forecasting a stronger Q2 than analysts predicted, but the fact that the coronavirus is spreading in unpredictable ways in China, where Apple has most of its hardware built, could upset this optimistic forecast,\" said eMarketer principal analyst Yoram Wurmser. The number of active iPhones, computers and other devices owned by customers, called Apple's installed base, grew by 100 million to more than 1.5 billion over the past year. Apple executives set a new target of 600 million paid subscribers for music, TV, gaming and other services by the end of calendar 2020. Apple\u2019s share price has more than doubled since Cook warned a year ago that the company was likely to miss financial targets for its biggest sales quarter of its fiscal 2019. In the year since, Apple slashed prices in China, one of its most important markets, to rekindle sales there. Apple posted US$91.8 billion in revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 28, compared with analyst estimates of US$88.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Apple reported earnings per share of US$4.99, compared with analyst estimates of US$4.55 per share. The company forecast US$63.0 billion to US$67.0 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, ahead of estimates of US$62.4 billion, showing it believes that its phones and other devices such as AirPods wireless headphones will continue to sell well during what is often a slow time of year. Apple has made a push into paid services, rolling out a credit card with Goldman Sachs and subscription gaming and television services last year. Services revenue was US$12.7 billion, below analyst estimates of US$13 billion, and up from US$10.9 billion the year before. \"Services are important, but the trajectory is heading on target. I feel they\u2019ve made good progress on that front,\" said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel. The shift towards services, however, depends on Apple continuing to grow its base of users and sign them up for recurring subscriptions that analysts view as potentially more lucrative than hardware sales. Apple said it now has more than 1.5 billion active installed devices and 480 million subscribers to both its own and third-party paid services, compared with 1.4 billion devices and 360 million subscribers a year earlier. Cook said the company's Apple TV+ subscription streaming video service released last fall was a \"rousing success\" and that it is \"very strong, both the people that are getting it in the bundle and the people that are paying for it that haven't bought a new device.\" IPhone sales of US$55.96 billion beat analyst estimates of US$51.6 billion and year-before sales of US$52 billion, snapping a yearlong trend of major sales declines for Apple\u2019s biggest-selling hardware product. Cook said that the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models drove the growth and also factored into the company's forecast, calling the devices \"the strongest iPhone lineup we've ever had.\" But Apple\u2019s wearables segment \u2013 which, along with AirPods, also includes the Apple Watch \u2013 hit US$10.0 billion in revenue versus estimates of US$9.5 billion, up sharply from US$7.3 billion the year before. Cook told Reuters that Apple could not make enough AirPods and Apple Watch Series 3 devices to meet demand during the fiscal first quarter and continues to be short on both. Cook said Apple does not have an estimate for when it will be able to fulfil demand for AirPods. \"We're working on both of those very hard,\" Cook told Reuters.

The plane landed at Haneda airport around 8.45am (1145 GMT), with officials saying 206 people were on board. Airport workers wearing face masks immediately began unloading luggage from the aircraft, and several buses pulled up, but there was no immediate sign of passengers leaving the plane. Ambulances could be seen nearby. Earlier, health ministry officials said medical professionals on board the flight would carry out health checks but that there were no plans to quarantine the arriving passengers. The flight arrives as several countries work to extract their nationals from Wuhan, with an American charter flight also due to leave the city on Wednesday, bound for an airport in the Los Angeles area. The Japanese flight arrived in Wuhan overnight carrying emergency relief supplies including 15,000 masks, 50,000 pairs of gloves and 8,000 protective glasses, the foreign ministry said. Around four medical officials were also on board to monitor returning passengers. Government officials said Tuesday that evacuees would be asked to fill out a health questionnaire and that anyone displaying symptoms on the flight would be taken to hospital immediately upon arrival in Japan. All passengers were expected to be tested for the new strain of coronavirus, which has killed more than 100 people and infected thousands. The evacuees would be asked to remain at home and avoid crowds at least until the results of the test were known, officials said. Those who live in and near Tokyo will be allowed to head home, while those living further away will be taken to local hotels initially. Japan's health ministry has so far confirmed seven cases of the virus in the country, including one man who had not travelled to China. The man from the western region of Nara had driven a tour bus with tourists from Wuhan twice in January, the health ministry said.

More than 9,000 people signed a petition urging one of the area's school boards to keep children whose family members recently returned from China out of classrooms, and some businesses in Toronto's Chinatown are already recording a slowdown. SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, killed 44 people in the Toronto area, causing widespread fear and making Canada the only country outside Asia to report deaths from that virus in 2002-2003. So far the new coronavirus has killed more than 100 people in China. \"This is exactly what happened during SARS,\" Amy Go, interim national president of the Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice, told Reuters in reference to the school board petition. \"We really, really have to check that we are not being overwhelmed by irrational fear and irrational panic,\" she said. The York Region School Board responded to the petition by saying it understood \"that students and their families are feeling some anxiety,\" but cautioned that anyone can contract and transmit the virus. The situation \"can regrettably give rise to discrimination based on perceptions, stereotypes and hate,\" the board said. Health Minister Patty Hajdu on Tuesday said there was a risk Chinese Canadians could feel \"somewhat targeted\" because of the origin of the virus, and that it could hurt their businesses if people shun them out of fear. But the Asian community is also among the most concerned about the virus, said Polly Chow, a Chinese-Canadian mother from Toronto. She said she agreed with the board petition, and with her son's private school \"emergency order\" that children be self-quarantined for 15 days if their families had travelled where there were confirmed cases. Chow described an atmosphere of fear and protectiveness among parents, and said many students in her son's class did not attend school on Monday. \"All the kids who didn't attend were all the Asian kids,\" she told Reuters. \"When you're Asian, you get exposed to news through the Asian media. You see more graphically what's happening in China, so that increases the fear.\" The South Asian and Chinese communities are the two largest visible minorities in Canada, and some 1.8 million people, or just under 5 per cent of the country's total population, are of Chinese descent. On Tuesday, authorities in British Columbia reported Canada's third case of the novel coronavirus in Vancouver. The first two to contract the virus in Canada - a husband and wife - live in Toronto. All three recently returned from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. Tonny Louie, chair of Toronto Chinatown Business Improvement Area, said business activity had already slowed due to concern over the virus, and scenes like the one Tuesday at Toronto's Chongqing Liuyishou Hot Pot, where all the employees wore surgical masks meant to protect them from contagion, do not help. \"The numbers are down,\" Louie said. \"There's not that many people in the street.\"","summary":"TORONTO: Canada has identified only three cases of the new coronavirus so far, but there are fears a more serious outbreak could stoke anti-Asian sentiment in scenes reminiscent of the SARS epidemic that killed dozens in the Toronto area in the early 2000s. More than 9,000 people signed a petition urging one of the area's school boards to keep children whose family members recently returned from China out of classrooms, and some businesses in Toronto's Chinatown are already recording a slowdown. SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, killed 44 people in the Toronto area, causing widespread fear and making Canada the only country outside Asia to report deaths from that virus in 2002-2003. \"This is exactly what happened during SARS,\" Amy Go, interim national president of the Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice, told Reuters in reference to the school board petition.

Long-term U.S. Treasury yields traded above short-term yields and the Japanese yen nursed losses as investors pulled back from safe-havens in favor of more risky assets like equities. Oil futures extended gains in Asia as pessimism about the virus eased somewhat and after OPEC sources said the cartel wants to extend crude output cuts by three months to June, easing concern about excess supplies. Other investors say the growing number of travel restrictions within China and the cancellation of international flights could prevent a significant worsening of the virus. \"The rise in Treasury yields shows the risk-off trade is falling out of favor,\" said Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co in Tokyo. \"This is supportive of Japanese stocks.

After the market close, Apple reported better-than-expected profits for the fourth quarter and forecast revenue in the current quarter above Wall Street expectations. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  rose to 1.6493per cent versus a yield of 1.5821per cent on three-month Treasury bills in another sign that sentiment has stabilized. The yield curve briefly inverted on Tuesday when 10-year yields fell below their 3-month counterparts for the first time since October. An inverted yield curve has historically been an indicator of looming recession. Markets in Asia could be subdued before the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting later on Wednesday. The Fed is expected to reiterate its desire to keep rates unchanged at least through this year. In currency markets, the safe-haven yen was quoted at 109.13 per dollar following a 0.2per cent loss on Tuesday. The Swiss franc, another popular safe haven, traded at 0.9730 versus the dollar, close to its lowest in almost three weeks.

A total of 206 Japanese citizens landed at Tokyo's Haneda airport on Wednesday morning, with health professionals carrying out checks on board and at the airport, but no mandatory quarantine was planned. Four passengers who said they felt unwell were taken to hospital on arrival, government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said, but there was no confirmation yet of whether they were infected with the virus. The flight arrived as several countries work to extract their nationals from Wuhan, with an American charter flight also leaving the city on Wednesday, bound for an airport in the Los Angeles area. Takeo Aoyama, a Nippon Steel employee who arrived on the evacuation flight, described confusion in Wuhan, with travel restrictions intended to contain the virus making it hard for those in the epicentre to know what was happening. \"The number of patients began increasing rapidly at a certain point. That was very worrying,\" he told reporters at the airport. \"We were not able to move freely, so we only had partial information. The restrictions on the flow of goods and transport were extremely strict,\" he said. He said food was available, but supply was uncertain, with shops selling out on some days. \"It wasn't a situation where we couldn't get anything at all. But it wasn't a situation where you could get anything freely, either,\" Aoyama said. Takayuki Kato, who worked in Wuhan for the firm Intec, said the atmosphere inside the city had changed as the scale of the crisis became clear. \"Everyone in the city began wearing masks. On the 23rd, when transport was shut down, I became very alarmed,\" he said. He said he was careful to wash his hands and rinse out his mouth, and hoped that would be sufficient to keep him healthy. The evacuation had gone smoothly, he said. The flight \"was quiet. People were cool-headed\". The Japan flight arrived in Wuhan overnight, carrying emergency relief supplies including 15,000 masks, 50,000 pairs of gloves and 8,000 protective glasses, the foreign ministry said. Around four medical officials were also on board to monitor returning passengers and administer health questionnaires. All passengers will be tested for the new strain of coronavirus, which has killed more than 130 people and infected thousands. And while there were no plans to confine the arrivals, the evacuees would be asked to remain at home in \"self-quarantine\" at least until the results of their tests were known, officials said. Those with somewhere to stay in and near Tokyo would be allowed to head there, while those wanting to go further afield would be taken to local hotels initially. Japan's health ministry has so far confirmed seven cases of the virus in the country, including one man who had not travelled to China. The man from the western region of Nara had driven a tour bus with tourists from Wuhan twice in January, the health ministry said. Japan's foreign ministry says around 650 Japanese nationals in the Wuhan area have asked to be repatriated, and local media reported Wednesday that Tokyo was preparing to send a second charter flight, possibly later Wednesday, to collect more people. Chinese authorities said Wednesday that the number of confirmed deaths in the outbreak has risen to 132 nationwide, with the confirmed total of infections now nearly 6,000. More than 50 million people have been locked down in and around Wuhan, the central industrial city where the outbreak first began, in a bid by authorities to stop an infection that has since spread to other cities in China and to other countries.","summary":"TOKYO: Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan, the epicentre of a deadly virus outbreak, described an atmosphere of confusion and fear in the Chinese city and expressed relief as they arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday (Jan 29).

Japan's health ministry has so far confirmed seven cases of the virus in the country, including one man who had not travelled to China. Japan's foreign ministry says around 650 Japanese nationals in the Wuhan area have asked to be repatriated, and local media reported Wednesday that Tokyo was preparing to send a second charter flight, possibly later Wednesday, to collect more people. More than 50 million people have been locked down in and around Wuhan, the central industrial city where the outbreak first began, in a bid by authorities to stop an infection that has since spread to other cities in China and to other countries.","datetime":1580296740000,"date_time":1580298352000},{"title":"China battles Wuhan virus spread with masks and disinfectant","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/asia\/wuhan-virus-china-society-stay-home-12364338","article":"BEIJING: At a deserted restaurant in China's capital, one black-and-white sign stands out among colourful the decor and neon signs advertising braised meat dishes: \"This store has been disinfected today.\" People in Beijing and across China are donning masks, spraying antiseptic and staying off the streets in a battle to halt the spread of a viral outbreak that has killed more than 130 people nationwide and gripped the country with fear of getting sick. Authorities are disinfecting trains and planes while people are encouraged to stay home during the Chinese New Year holiday or wear masks if they go out. Businesses like the Hao Lu Wei braised meat restaurant, located in an eerily quiet mall in central Beijing, are scrubbing their facilities to reassure wary customers. Many others have just remained shut. \"Please be assured while shopping that our store has been comprehensively disinfected, and have a Happy New Year!\" read a sign in the window of a glasses store, devoid of patrons. The capital of 20 million people is normally quiet around the holiday as migrant workers return home to visit family, but news of the rapidly spreading infection has left malls and boulevards exceptionally silent. Anxious shoppers desperate to protect themselves from infection have stripped stores of hand sanitisers. \"There has been nothing since before the New Year,\" said Li, a 35-year-old pharmacist clad in a thick face mask, turning away a delivery driver looking to fetch rubbing alcohol on behalf of a customer waiting at home. Health workers in hazmat suits have set up screening checkpoints at subway station entrances, while officers at one police station forbade entry without temperature checks. Some residential buildings are checking the temperatures of visitors. Only a handful of patrons milled through the upscale Taikoo Li shopping centre on Tuesday, as security staff posted signs urging shoppers to cover their faces and the smell of disinfectant hung thick in the air. Southern Guangdong province, which has 110 million people, ordered residents to wear face masks in public. Other local governments have issued similar edicts across the country, prompting authorities to rush to ensure factories can churn out more masks. Even more drastic measures have been taken in Wuhan, the industrial city in central China where the new coronavirus outbreak was first detected. It - and several neighbouring cities in Hubei province - have been almost completely sealed off, with authorities grounding flights, halting trains and banning car travel for more than 50 million people. Some in China have coped with the boredom of being confined to their homes through wry social media posts. One video circulating on the messaging app WeChat shows a group of middle-aged men and women playing mahjong while wearing masks - and transparent plastic bags covering their heads. A popular meme shared on the platform, as well as other social media networks, shows a well-known dinner scene from My Fair Princess - a popular 1990s TV costume drama - with surgical masks photoshopped onto the actors' faces. In another widely circulated image, a man protects himself from the virus by wearing two surgical masks covering his entire face, with holes cut out for his eyes. On the streets of Beijing, not everyone has fallen victim to the anxiety sweeping the country. One couple in their 30s stood on the street in the city's otherwise empty Sanlitun entertainment district and removed their face masks to smoke cigarettes. The man carried several plush toys won from the claw machine games inside a nearby arcade. He said he assumed the machines were being disinfected regularly, but wasn't sure. \"We came here because we don't know what else to do,\" the man, who asked not to be named, told AFP. \"We try to stay at home as much as possible.\"","summary":"BEIJING: At a deserted restaurant in China's capital, one black-and-white sign stands out among colourful the decor and neon signs advertising braised meat dishes: \"This store has been disinfected today.\" People in Beijing and across China are donning masks, spraying antiseptic and staying off the streets in a battle to halt the spread of a viral outbreak that has killed more than 130 people nationwide and gripped the country with fear of getting sick.

WASHINGTON: The Federal Reserve will conclude its latest policy meeting on Wednesday with interest rates almost certainly to remain on hold but officials likely to discuss possible changes to how they manage the U.S. central bank's key overnight borrowing rate. Since the Fed cut rates in October, its third and final reduction in borrowing costs in 2019, policymakers have agreed to keep their target policy rate in the current range of 1.50per cent and 1.75per cent until there is some significant change in the economic outlook. U.S. data since the Fed's last policy meeting in December have done little to shift expectations for continued economic growth this year of around 2per cent and steady, low unemployment. Some risks may have risen - with China's economic growth now in the spotlight after a coronavirus outbreak - and U.S. Treasury bond yields have fallen as a result. U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday also repeated his call for even lower rates. The Republican president lambasted the Fed and its chief, Jerome Powell, in 2018 and 2019 for maintaining a monetary policy that he regarded as too tight. While investors have increased bets the Fed would cut rates again at some point this year, analysts still were near unanimous that any such decision is months down the road. Ninety-five of 108 economists polled by Reuters recently said they expected the Fed to leave rates on hold at this week's meeting, and JP Morgan analyst Michael Feroli said it would likely be \"one of the least eventful meetings in recent years.\" The Fed is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT). Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference half an hour later. The current solid consensus over rates, however, doesn't mean the agenda is empty. The Fed is expected to soon decide how much longer it will continue its current practice of buying US$60 billion a month in U.S. Treasury bonds, how to scale that program back, and what will replace it as a long-term fix for its management of short-term bank funding markets. Pumping that extra liquidity into the banking system each month has allowed the Fed to keep short-term interest rates within the target range, addressing an issue that arose last fall when a shortage of bank reserves led that rate to spike. But it is considered less than an ideal fix. It means the Fed each month is adding to its roughly US$4 trillion in assets. Some policymakers would prefer the central bank have a smaller balance sheet if possible. It has also created the impression that the Fed is engaging in a scaled-down form of the \"quantitative easing\" it used to prop up the economy in response to the 2007-2009 recession. Fed officials argue against that comparison, but they face the issue of how to scale the monthly purchases back without risking fallout in asset markets where the extra central bank liquidity is considered a \"tailwind\" that helps lift prices. \"The question is when, not if,\" the balance sheet growth stops, Cornerstone Macro analyst Roberto Perli wrote. \"We expect Powell to convey this message but to stay vague on timing, for now.\" As they discuss how to end this current round of asset purchases, Fed officials are also debating what could take its place. Some policymakers support a permanent offering of short-term \"repo\" loans that banks could tap as needed, a system they say would allow reserve levels to be set by banks. In a related adjustment, the Fed may also raise by perhaps five basis points the interest rate it pays banks on excess reserves as a way to keep the federal funds rate closer to the middle of the current policy target rate.","summary":"The Federal Reserve will conclude its latest policy meeting on Wednesday with interest rates almost certainly to remain on hold but officials likely to discuss possible changes to how they manage the U.S. central bank's key overnight borrowing rate.

United Airlines Holdings Inc , Air Canada  , Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd  and Finnair Plc  are among the carriers that have already canceled some flights to China as countries expand travel warnings and demand plummets due to the coronavirus outbreak. British Airways  has halted bookings of direct flights from London to Beijing and Shanghai until March, according to its website. The virus that has killed more than 130 people and sickened more than 6,000, the vast majority of whom are in China. U.S. officials said the White House had decided against suspending all flights there for now, but was still considering the measure. The virus appears to represent the biggest epidemic threat to the airline industry since the SARS outbreak, which at its peak in April 2003 led to a 45per cent plunge in passenger demand in Asia, analysts said. The global airline industry has been profitable for the last 10 years, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Airlines are in a stronger financial position than in 2003, but also far more dependent on China. \"Airlines and airports that are financially strong and well managed are able to overcome a drastic drop in air travel,\" said Shukor Yusof, head of Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. \"Weak and poorly managed airlines will suffer.\" Margins at many carriers remain narrow, economic growth has been fragile amid a U.S.-China trade war and there are fears that the return of the 737 MAX, expected mid-year, could lead to overcapacity and push down fares. Airbus and Boeing orders have fallen from the peak levels of 2013 and 2014. The epidemic is particularly concerning to the industry because China is the world's biggest outbound international travel market and the second-largest domestic aviation market. The country accounts for about 25per cent of global sales for airplane manufacturers Airbus SE  and Boeing Co . About 450 million more passengers fly to, from and within China per year compared with a decade ago, according to the IATA. For Chinese airlines, the biggest of which are state-backed, the impact of the new coronavirus has been swift. On Wednesday, 23per cent of departures from Shanghai Hongqiao airport had been canceled, according to FlightRadar24, compared with 8per cent at the more internationally focused Shanghai Pudong airport. Mike Boyd, head of U.S.-based aviation consultancy Boyd Group International, said that he had forecast airport traffic in China to rise 8.1per cent in 2020, but that he now sees traffic growing at less than half that rate. \"It is a real slam,\" he said. Cathay Pacific, already battered by a fall in demand because of anti-government protests in its home market of Hong Kong, said on Tuesday evening it would cut flights to mainland China by 50per cent or more through the end of March. The fate of Cathay and local rival Hong Kong Airlines could depend on the willingness of travelers to transit through Hong Kong airport, BOCOM International analyst Luya You said. The protests had already caused a collapse in demand from mainland tourists and business travelers, she said. Asian jet fuel prices have dropped and refiners' profits for the product have slumped to their lowest in more than 2-1\/2 years over concerns that the coronavirus will hurt demand, although that will also help unhedged carriers keep a lid on costs. U.S. and European carriers have less relative exposure to the Chinese market than their Asian rivals. Chinese carriers, which have a huge home market, dominate airline travel between China and long-haul destinations. But they were racking up international losses even before the virus broke out. Flights to China account for 2per cent-6per cent of estimated revenue at United Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc , American Airlines Group Inc  and Air Canada, according to analysts at Cowen, an independent investment bank, although they added there were concerns the virus would not be contained in China given how it was spreading. Historically, air traffic has returned to normal after health scares. In the case of SARS, it took nine months to recover, according to IATA. \"It (SARS) meant we did cut back on some international capacity but it rebounded very fast,\" Qantas Airways Ltd  Chief Executive Alan Joyce told reporters on Wednesday, saying that earnings took a AUS$55 million (US$37.61 million) hit from that epidemic. \"We do now have a lot of experience over the years with MERS, with Zika virus, with volcanoes, with all sorts of activity that's impacted the airlines,\" he said.

ANN ARBOR, Michigan: Work has begun at multiple organisations, including the United States\u2019 National Institutes of Health, to develop a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus, known among scientists as 2019-nCoV. Scientists are just getting started, but their vaccine development strategy will benefit both from work that has been done on closely related viruses, as well as advances that have been made in vaccine technologies. For instance, nucleic acid vaccines, which are DNA- and RNA-based vaccines, can produce the vaccine antigen in the patient\u2019s own body. While scientists have not been working on a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus prior to the outbreak, work has been ongoing for other closely related coronaviruses that have caused severe disease in humans, namely MERS and SARS. Scientists had not been concerned about this particular strain, as they did not know that it existed and could cause disease in humans until the outbreak. Work on vaccines for severe coronaviruses has historically begun once the viruses start infecting humans. Developing a vaccine involves designing the vaccine constructs \u2013 for example, producing the right target antigens, viral proteins that are targeted by the immune system, followed by testing in animal models to show that they are protective and safe. Once safety and efficacy are established, vaccines can advance into clinical trials in humans. If the vaccines induce the expected immune response and protection and are found safe, they can be mass produced for vaccination of the population. Currently, we lack virus isolates \u2013 or samples of the virus \u2013 to test the vaccines against. We also lack antibodies to make sure the vaccine is in good shape. We need the virus in order to test if the immune response induced by the vaccine works. We would also have to establish what animals to test the vaccine on. That potentially could include mice and nonhuman primates. Vaccine development will also likely take months. We expect that these types of outbreaks will occur for the foreseeable future in irregular intervals. To try to prevent large outbreaks and pandemics, we need to improve surveillance in both humans and animals worldwide as well as invest in risk assessment, allowing scientists to evaluate the potential threat of detected viruses. Given that this is the third major outbreak of a new coronavirus that we have had in the past two decades and the severity of the resulting diseases such as MERS and SARS, we should consider investing in the development of a vaccine that would be broadly protective against these viruses. We believe that global action is needed to invest in novel vaccine approaches that can be employed quickly whenever a new virus like the current coronavirus \u2013 and also viruses similar to Zika, Ebola or influenza \u2013 emerges. Currently, responses to emerging pathogens are mostly reactive, meaning they start after the outbreak happens. We need a more proactive approach supported by continuous funding.

On Tuesday (Jan 28), Thailand's Public Health Ministry announced that 14 people have tested positive for the virus \u2013 the highest number of cases outside China. \u201cFive patients have already gone home. The remaining nine are still receiving treatment at hospitals. Their conditions are good. As of now, no local transmission has been reported in Thailand,\u201d said Dr Tanarak Palipat, deputy director of the ministry's Disease Control Department. So far, health officials have monitored 158 travellers from China for potential signs of the Wuhan virus. Twenty-nine of them were detected at airports while 129 others sought medical treatment at hospitals themselves. \u201cWe continue to detect patients with symptoms that need monitoring every single day,\u201d Dr Tanarak told reporters at a press conference in Bangkok. All of the confirmed cases had travelled to Thailand from China. The ministry said it has prepared for the \"worst-case scenario\" as the Wuhan virus continues to spread across China and the rest of the world.

Prime Minister Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha said in a national address on Monday that \u201cwe can control the situation 100 per cent\u201d. He also affirmed the readiness of the Thai medical system, citing the Global Health Security Index of 2019 where Thailand ranked sixth out of 195 countries. \u201cInfection of the new coronavirus is preventable,\u201d Gen Prayut said. \u201cOur screening and monitoring continues with intensity.\u201d Passengers travelling from China to Thai airports are required to go through temperature screening.

There have been confirmed cases in multiple countries, including Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and France. Singapore began imposing travel restrictions on Wednesday on holders of Chinese passports issued in Hubei province, where the virus was first reported. The Philippine government has also stopped issuing visas on arrival to Chinese nationals. Although Thailand has confirmed the highest number of infections outside China, it continues to welcome Chinese travellers, Dr Tanarak said. \u201cWorld Health Organization (WHO) often says limiting trade and travel is an unrecommended means of disease prevention. And up until today, the WHO has not recommended limiting trade and travel,\u201d Dr Tanarak added. Wuhan has been on lockdown since Jan 23. Prior to that, about 5 million people left the city ahead of the Chinese New Year holidays. While many travelled to other parts of China, some had travelled overseas, including to Bangkok. Despite the threat of infection, many people in Bangkok have continued their daily routines, with some donning face masks to protect themselves. \u201cI wear a face mask every time I go outside,\u201d said Pornthawan Chanchitsophon, a Bangkok resident with a young child. \u201cWe try to avoid malls and crowded places, and even cancelled our trip to Pattaya during the Chinese New Year holidays. \"The city is popular among Chinese tourists and it\u2019d be difficult to take care of ourselves. \"I\u2019m quite worried because children have a weak immune system.

McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski, who took charge in November after the former CEO was dismissed, said global comparable sales growth in 2019 was the chain's highest in more than 10 years. But the company continues to battle lower U.S. store traffic and faces stiff competition in breakfast against rivals including Starbucks Corp  and Dunkin' Brands Group Inc , as well as the Wendy's Co  impending launch into morning menu items. \"Breakfast remains the area of focus to further improve U.S. traffic,\" Guggenheim analyst Matthew DiFrisco said. Over the past few years, McDonald's has added kiosks, digital displays and delivery partners, as well as new burgers, beverages and breakfast foods. It also began modernizing stores across the globe and bought two smaller technology firms that focus on digitizing stores and drive-thru menus. Sales in U.S. restaurants open for more than 13 months rose 5.1per cent for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, slightly above the estimate of a 4.67per cent increase. Still, the number of customers at its U.S. restaurants fell 1.9per cent in the quarter, though that was better than the 2.2per cent decline for 2018. \"Returning to guest count growth in the U.S. remains our top priority,\" Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said in a post-earnings conference call.

Remaining McDonald's stores - about 3,000 - in the rest of China are still open, Kempczinski said. The virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has spread across the world and prompted companies to close stores and restrict travel. Starbucks on Tuesday said it expected a material, though temporary, impact to its 2020 finances as the virus led it to close about 2,000 stores there. However, for McDonald's, China makes up only about 4per cent to 5per cent of systemwide sales and 3per cent of operating income. In early 2017 it sold 80per cent of its business there, though it still collects royalty fees and considers China important for potential growth. In the United States, about 70per cent of its 14,000 stores have finished upgrading to more modern counters and dining areas. This year, it expects to spend about US$2.4 billion on capital expenditures, about the same amount as last year. About half of that will be in the United States.

About 500 to 600 pre-school teachers had gone to or returned from China for various reasons such as study trips and vacations, said Mr Lee. He also estimated that about 1,000 out of 180,000 pre-school children in Singapore would have gone to or returned from China. \"We believe it's manageable.

NEW YORK: Large options trades some people have attributed to the mysterious investor known as \"50 Cent\" have become more profitable in recent days, as fears of the economic impact of the coronavirus injected volatility back into stock markets. Earlier this month, at least one investor bought large blocks of February calls on the CBOE Volatility Index  at a price of around 50 cents each. The calls, which increase in value when the VIX rises, would be redeemable should the VIX hit 22 by late February. Known as Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge,\u201d the index typically rises when markets grow turbulent. The VIX ended Tuesday's session at 16.28, down 2.74 points from yesterday's three-month high. In total, there were last about 331,000 contracts open on those calls, most of which were purchased around the same price, according to options analytics provider Trade Alert. Pravit Chintawongvanich, equity derivatives strategist at Wells Fargo, said the transaction resembles past moves by an enigmatic investor some market participants have dubbed \u201c50 Cent,\u201d known for purchasing large blocks of VIX options at prices near 50 cents. A trader believed to be 50 Cent made similar big purchases last summer and in the months leading up to a market selloff in February 2018. According to Trade Alert, the VIX calls traded as high as US$1.15 on Monday, so in total they could have generated some US$21 million in profit if the calls were sold. However, there was \"no sign of liquidation,\" Trade Alert founder Henry Schwartz wrote. The calls were trading between 70 and 80 cents late Tuesday, as U.S. stock markets rebounded. \"They would basically need a much bigger market reaction to make any meaningful profit on those trades,\" Chintawongvanich said. The block trades are likely a portfolio hedge rather than a bet on a spike in volatility, he added. On Monday and Tuesday, at least one investor bought large blocks of March VIX calls, at 57.5 cents and 59 cents, which would require the index to reach 28 before they could be redeemed. Outside of those trades, it was not evident that investors are loading up on downside protection at this point. \"When the VIX stays below 17, that's pretty sedate,\" said Jim Carney, CEO of hedge fund Parplus Partners.

The ministry that promotes the country's booming yoga, naturopathy and homeopathy sectors released an advisory listing herbal oils to be rubbed into the scalp to purportedly ease the symptoms. It also suggested ingesting Arsenicum album-30, a homeopathic treatment. The ministry also issued general advice on maintaining personal hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus. The advisory came as the Dalai Lama, in exile in Dharamsala in India, said on Facebook that followers concerned about the virus should chant a mantra that would be \"helpful\" in dealing with the situation. India claims to have natural remedies for everything from cancer to the common cold. The government in recent years has launched a drive to promote traditional remedies as it seeks to cash in on the multi-billion dollar global market for holistic medicine. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a yoga practitioner, has said he wants the world to make Ayurveda \"a way of life\". Ayurvedic medicine - which means the \"science of life\" in Sanskrit - treats the physical and mental sources of illness through, for example, prescribing herbs in conjunction with yoga or massage. The ministry said that homeopathy, the treatment of diseases with alternative medicines prescribed in minute doses, is the main source of healthcare for some 10 per cent of India's 1.3-billion population.

The AIU's recommendation, made to the council of World Athletics, comes after it assessed the explanations provided by the federation regarding its leadership's involvement in serious breaches of anti-doping rules. Russia's athletics federation was initially suspended in 2015 after a report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of mass doping in the sport and had since been trudging towards reinstatement. But in November last year, World Athletics, the global governing body of athletics formerly known as the IAAF, halted Russia's reinstatement process and raised the prospect of expelling the federation altogether over doping violations by its president and several of its representatives. The AIU, the independent unit set up by the sport's governing body in 2017 to manage integrity issues, had provisionally suspended Dmitry Shlyakhtin, the Russian federation's president, and six other people for having provided forged documents to justify a whereabouts violation by high jumper Danil Lysenko. In a strong statement on Wednesday, the AIU said the federation had not put \"forward any material or evidence that it contends answers the AIU's case against it\", despite having been granted three extensions to provide its explanations. It said the federation had instead denied its involvement and blamed others. \"The AIU Board finds it regrettable that, in the face of clear and compelling evidence, RUSAF has chosen not to admit to the acts and omissions of the employees, directors and representatives...\" the AIU said in a statement. \"A responsible member federation in the circumstances would have admitted the charges and shown contrition for its conduct, but RUSAF has chosen to do neither.\" The AIU recommended that World Athletics expel and fine the federation as part of \"severest possible consequences\" if its the anti-doping breaches are upheld. Following the AIU's recommendations on Wednesday, World Athletics said the charges brought against the Russian athletics federation were \"extremely serious\" and that it would review them in the coming days. It also suggested that Russia could possibly avoid expulsion if its officials came clean and admitted their involvement in the scandal. World Athletics said it would start by sending a letter to the federation's acting president and Oleg Matytsin, Russia's next sports minister, to lay out the country's options before the dispute gets to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). It said that if federation officials admit the AIU charges, the World Athletics council will decide on the sanctions to impose against the federation, but these would not include expulsion at that stage. It will also decide on a new process to clear Russians to compete internationally, World Athletics said. The AIU last year halted the process used since 2016 to clear some Russian track and field athletes to compete internationally as neutrals, including three-times world high jump champion Maria Lasitskene. It said on Wednesday that the process would remain suspended until the charges against the federation were determined. This means that Russia's top track and field athletes are likely to miss the world indoor championships set to be held in the Chinese city of Nanjing in March. But if Russia's federation officials continue to deny involvement, World Athletics said it will \"put all necessary resource into presenting the charges to the CAS\". Russia's athletics federation had no immediate comment. In a jab at the federation, world champion pole vaulter Anzhelika Sidorova tagged it in an Instagram story and wrote \"good job\", accompanied by three flexed biceps emojis. Russia is also in the process of appealing a four-year ban from competing under its flag at major international sporting events, including this year's Tokyo Olympics, after WADA found Moscow had provided it with doctored laboratory data. The World Athletics council will convene on the sidelines of the world indoor championships in March, but the event could be moved because of the outbreak of the coronavirus in the country.","summary":"REUTERS: The Athletics Integrity Unit Board on Wednesday called for the expulsion of Russia's suspended athletics federation (RUSAF) after what it described as a \"total lack of contrition\" in its response to a long list of anti-doping violations.

The novel coronavirus outbreak traced to the provincial capital Wuhan in central China has killed more than 130 people and infected nearly 6,000 people across the country. That has prompted factories and businesses to close, airlines to cancel flights to the country and governments to discourage travel to China.

LONDON: Morgan Stanley said on Wednesday the coronavirus outbreak in China was likely to hurt global growth in the near-term and could shave up to 1 percentage point off Chinese growth in the first quarter. Assuming the coronavirus peaks in February or March, global economic growth could be reduced by 0.15 to 0.3 percentage point during the first quarter, the bank said. The United States and Japan flew their nationals out of China's virus epicentre on Wednesday, and some big-name airlines suspended flights, as deaths leapt to 133. \"There should be some adverse impact to 1Q20 global growth,\" Morgan Stanley said, referring to the first quarter of this year. \"But as the underlying drivers of the global recovery remain intact, growth should get back onto the recovery path once the effects of disruption fade.\" If the outbreak continues for three to four months, global growth could be further hit by about 0.2 to 0.4 percentage point in the second quarter, it said. Most major central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will stay in a dovish holding pattern as they assess the impact of the outbreak, it said. In China, it said travel, entertainment and retail could be most affected and extended factory suspension could weigh on industrial output and trade. If the virus peaks in February or March, first-quarter growth in the world's second-largest economy could suffer by 0.5 to 1 percentage point, although recovery beyond the period could be intact amid restocking demand and counter-cyclical policy. But if the virus instead peaks in three to four months, first-half Chinese growth could be dragged down by 0.6 to 1.1 percentage points, although that could be partly offset by stronger policy support. China's A-share market will likely open lower on Feb. 3 after the Lunar New Year holiday and Chinese and Hong Kong equities, as well as other equity markets in North Asia, will likely underperform global and regional benchmarks during the escalation phase of the outbreak, Morgan Stanley said.

The WHO warned all governments to \"take action\" over the deadly SARS-like virus spreading from China, as hundreds of foreigners were evacuated from the epicentre of the outbreak. So far, the novel coronavirus has claimed more than 160 lives in China and infected more than 7,000 people in the country and elsewhere. New cases were reported in Finland and the United Arab Emirates. The WHO called an urgent meeting for Thursday over whether the viral epidemic should be declared a global health emergency - a designation that can lead to increased international coordination. Twice last week it declined to do so, citing a need for more information and evidence, but the virus has spread rapidly and has now been detected in 15 other countries. \"The continued increase in cases and the evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China are of course both deeply concerning. Although the numbers outside China are still relatively small, they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak,\" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. \"In the last few days the progress of virus especially in some countries, especially human-to-human transmission worries us - in Germany, in Vietnam and also in Japan,\" Tedros told the news conference, speaking on return from China. \"If this gets into a country with a weak health system then that can be problematic,\" he added. Airlines around the world are either suspending or paring back services in and out of China, following cases of human-to-human transmission outside the country.In the sporting world, the World Indoor Athletics Championships set for March in Nanjing have been pushed back to 2021, and World Cup skiing races have been cancelled.\"WHO is monitoring this outbreak every moment of every day,\" the organization's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva, as he announced his decision to convene crisis talks.On Twitter, Tedros said the organisation \"deeply regrets\" what he called a \"human error\" in WHO reports last week that referred to the global risk of the outbreak as \"moderate\" instead of \"high\". WHO deeply regrets the error in this week's situation report, which inserted the word \u201cmoderate\u201d inaccurately in the #coronavirus global risk assessment.

AIRLIFTS IN FULL SWINGIn China, some countries worked to airlift their citizens out of the central city of Wuhan, whose 11 million residents are now under strict quarantine.A US charter flight from Wuhan with about 210 Americans on board, including consular staff, was met at a California military base on Wednesday by emergency vehicles with flashing lights and personnel in white biological hazard suits.The evacuees will be monitored for symptoms and sent to local hospitals if they are found to be ill, the Pentagon said. More than 200 Japanese nationals were brought home Wednesday, but only a handful of them were hospitalised for tests after they reported they felt unwell or showed flu-like symptoms.Some 250 French citizens and 100 other Europeans will be flown out of Wuhan on board two French planes this week.Australia plans to house any citizens evacuated on an island normally used to detain asylum seekers.A growing number of governments - including the United States, Britain and Germany - have advised their citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China.China has urged its own citizens to delay trips abroad, with more than 15 other countries having confirmed cases of the disease, including three with cases of human-to-human transmission.FLIGHTS SCRAPPED, STORES CLOSEDBritish Airways was the first major airline to announce a suspension of flights to and from China, citing the travel advice of Britain's foreign office.Many others followed suit, including German flag carrier Lufthansa, which said all flights to mainland China would be suspended until Feb 9.Others pared back their service, like American Airlines, KLM and United.Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific has reduced flights, citing low demand and the city government's response plan to the virus.In one of the most dramatic measures, the Pacific nation of Papua New Guinea announced no travellers from Asia would be allowed in.\"Although the numbers outside China are still relatively small, they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak,\" Tedros said.\"I NEED TO BUY FOOD\" China has effectively cut off Hubei province to try to contain the spread of the virus, banned tour groups from travelling overseas, suspended classes and extended the Lunar New Year holiday.Most street traffic in and around Wuhan - where the virus originated in a wild animal market - has been banned, leaving more than 50 million people shuttered in their homes.\"This is the first day since the lockdown that I've had to go out,\" a man in his 50s told AFP on the mostly deserted streets of the industrial city on Wednesday.\"I have no choice because I need to buy food.\"The number of confirmed cases across China climbed to 5,974, while the death toll nationwide jumped to 132.The scale of the deepening crisis was emphasised with the total number of infections on the Chinese mainland exceeding that of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03.But the death toll is so far much lower than SARS, which claimed nearly 800 lives around the world - with most fatalities in mainland China and Hong Kong.ECONOMIC PAIN The virus has rattled global markets and started to dent the Chinese economy.

Airlines around the world are either suspending or paring back services in and out of China, following cases of human-to-human transmission outside the country.In the sporting world, the World Indoor Athletics Championships set for March in Nanjing have been pushed back to 2021, and World Cup skiing races have been cancelled.\"WHO is monitoring this outbreak every moment of every day,\" the organization's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva, as he announced his decision to convene crisis talks.On Twitter, Tedros said the organisation \"deeply regrets\" what he called a \"human error\" in WHO reports last week that referred to the global risk of the outbreak as \"moderate\" instead of \"high\".

REUTERS: Greater certainty around Argentina's public policies could help reactivate growth and investments in the recession-hit South American country, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday. \"As new public policies are announced it will decrease uncertainty, which is very high in the Argentine economy,\" said Alejandro Werner, the IMF's director for the Western Hemisphere. \"That will help reactivate growth, reactivate investments.\" Argentina is gearing up to restructure around US$100 billion in sovereign debt, including part of a US$57 billion credit facility that the IMF extended the country in 2018.

An IMF technical team will travel to Buenos Aires in February https:\/\/reut.rs\/2GyMZJw. The Fund did not change its economic growth projections for Argentina from the October estimates due in part to the fact that Alberto Fernandez's government was installed just under two months ago, Werner said. In a press conference in Washington, Werner said it is \"premature\" to estimate the economic impact of the spread of a new coronavirus that originated in China, where Argentina and Brazil export large amounts of agricultural products. \"It is going to have an effect on the economic cycle of countries that are most tied to China and obviously in the perishable sectors,\" he said, noting that a similar virus scare in the early 2000's barely altered economic growth trends in the region. On Brazil, Werner said the Fund expects structural reforms to continue following the approval of a key pension reform. He added that uncertainty over key pillars of the Chilean economy following weeks of street protests and the possibility of a constitutional change were behind the sharp cut to the Fund's growth estimates for the country. The IMF now expects the Chilean economy to grow 0.9per cent in 2020, down from a 3per cent estimate in October. For the whole of Latin America and the Caribbean, the Fund estimates 2020 growth of 1.6per cent down from 1.8per cent in October.

REUTERS: Tesla Inc  posted its second quarterly profit in a row as vehicle deliveries hit a record and the company said it would comfortably make more than half a million units this year, pushing its shares to new highs. The delivery forecast, higher by more than a third than last year's production, suggests Tesla is looking at a steadier chapter after years of steep losses, production troubles and clashes between chief executive Elon Musk and U.S. regulators. The electric carmaker's stock, which has nearly doubled in the past year, jumped 13per cent after hours on Wednesday, cracking the US$600 mark for the first time. Tesla said that the manufacturing process at its new Shanghai factory, which started delivering Model 3 sedans a month ago, was running as expected and that it would increase production of the mass-market cars because of strong demand in China. The US$2 billion Shanghai factory is key to Tesla's growth strategy. There it aims to produce 150,000 Model 3 sedans and later increase output to 250,000 a year, including the Model Y. But the company warned of a 1-1.5 week delay in the ramp of Shanghai-built Model 3 cars because China ordered a shutdown of the factory after a new coronavirus breakout that has killed 170 people and infected thousands. \"This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages,\" Tesla's chief financial officer Zachary Kirkhorn said on a post-earnings call. The company is evaluating whether it will be hurt by the virus and whether the supply chain for cars built in its Fremont, California plant will be affected, he said. Tesla said it started production of the new electric crossover utility vehicle Model Y at the Fremont factory this month and plans to deliver the first cars by the end of March, ahead of schedule. Tesla already starting Model Y production was the most notable item in the release, Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin wrote in a note. \"For a company that has always been late, this is a big improvement,\" he said. Tesla initially did not expect to make the Model Y until late 2020 and then moved up the forecast to this summer, finally beating that deadline by several months. The results indicate that Tesla is controlling costs better, a metric that investors have questioned Musk on before and that he was quick to talk about on the call. \"In 2019, we managed to generate more than US$1 billion of free cash flow while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y production,\" he said. Tesla's cash balance increased to US$6.3 billion and total operating expenses rose less than 1per cent to US$1.03 billion in the December quarter. And while its revenue per unit delivered rose by only 3per cent in the fourth quarter, operating profits per vehicle rose by roughly 19per cent. (Graphic: https:\/\/fingfx.thomsonreuters.com\/gfx\/editorcharts\/TESLA-RESULTS\/0H001R884BN6\/index.html) Tesla, which last week overtook Volkswagen  as the second-most valuable carmaker behind Japan's Toyota Motor Corp , still trails luxury carmaker rivals on steady profits per vehicle, a key metric. (Graphic: https:\/\/fingfx.thomsonreuters.com\/gfx\/editorcharts\/TESLA-RESULTS\/0H001R87WBMF\/index.html) Some analysts have questioned the more than US$104 billion valuation, but investors are betting that Tesla has overcome its many struggles and can compete with larger, better capitalized rivals to lead the industry in technological innovation for next-generation cars. The company's debt pile is high as well, amounting to US$13.42 billion at the end of 2019. Tesla reported a 4.9per cent operating margin in the fourth quarter and said Model Y production and the Shanghai factory ramp-up were likely to weigh on margins temporarily. Its new initiatives, which also include the construction of its first European factory in Germany, an electric pickup truck, a new generation of the Tesla Roadster and automated driving features, are also likely to put a strain on its cash pile. Net income attributable to common shareholders fell to US$105 million, or 56 cents per share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, from US$140 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to US$7.38 billion from US$7.23 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of US$7.02 billion.

(Graphic: https:\/\/fingfx.thomsonreuters.com\/gfx\/editorcharts\/TESLA-RESULTS\/0H001R87WBMF\/index.html) Some analysts have questioned the more than US$104 billion valuation, but investors are betting that Tesla has overcome its many struggles and can compete with larger, better capitalized rivals to lead the industry in technological innovation for next-generation cars. Tesla reported a 4.9per cent operating margin in the fourth quarter and said Model Y production and the Shanghai factory ramp-up were likely to weigh on margins temporarily.","datetime":1580362560000,"date_time":1580423372000},{"title":"Airlines suspend, scale back direct flights to China amid virus fears","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/business\/wuhan-virus-airlines-suspend-flights-china-12368770","article":"LONDON: Global airlines on Wednesday (Jan 29) continued to suspend or scale back direct flights to China's major cities amid an increase in travel warnings and decline in demand from passengers over the coronavirus. Fears over the spread of the flu-like virus, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, are increasing as the death toll rose to 133. The virus appears to represent the biggest epidemic threat to the airline industry since the SARS outbreak, which at its peak in April 2003 led to a 45 per cent plunge in passenger demand in Asia, analysts said. British Airways said it suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China. BA.com, the airline's website, shows no direct flights to mainland China are available to book in January or February, but the airline said in an email that the cancellations were in effect until Jan 31 while it assesses the situation. Indonesia's Lion Air Group, Southeast Asia's biggest carrier by fleet size, said it is halting all flights to and from China starting Feb 1. Jetstar Asia said it would temporarily suspend services to Hefei, Guiyang and Xuzhou until Mar 31 \"when the situation will be reviewed again\". Its last flights to Hefei, Guiyang and Xuzhou will operate on Thursday. Jetstar also said on Wednesday it was suspending the sale of flights from Singapore to Hong Kong, with the last flight set for Mar 28, but said this was unrelated to the coronavirus outbreak and instead due to \"ongoing falling demand\". Air Canada, which planned earlier this week to cancel just a select number of its 33 weekly flights to China, said on Wednesday that it would suspend all direct flights to Beijing and Shanghai. The suspension, from Jan 30 to Feb 29, came after the government of Canada updated its travel advisory urging its citizens to avoid nonessential travel to China. American Airlines Group Inc said on Wednesday it would suspend flights from Los Angeles to Beijing and Shanghai but continue flying from Dallas, and Delta Air Lines said it was halving its US-China schedule to about 21 weekly flights. US officials said the White House had decided against suspending all flights to China for now, but that decision could be changed if warranted. Among European carriers, Germany\u2019s Lufthansa is suspending its own, Swiss and Austrian Airlines flights to and from China until Feb 9, while Air France said it would reduce its flight schedule to Beijing and Shanghai this week. Iberia, part of the IAG group along with BA, said it was temporarily suspending all flights to Shanghai. Asia-Pacific accounts for about 19 per cent of both Air France-KLM and Lufthansa's available seat kilometres and 8 per cent of IAG's in 2019, Goodbody analysts said. Carriers, including Hong Kong\u2019s Cathay Pacific Airways, are allowing their flight attendants to wear face masks and gloves on flights to protect against fears of contagion risks. Wesley Lesosky, president of the Canadian Union of Public Employees unit that represents Air Canada flight attendants, said by email that members have the option of wearing masks and gloves on flights to China. But flight attendants remained \"concerned with the effects the virus could have if contracted, how to recognise an infected passenger and how to deal with the nervous passengers onboard\".","summary":"LONDON: Global airlines on Wednesday (Jan 29) continued to suspend or scale back direct flights to China's major cities amid an increase in travel warnings and decline in demand from passengers over the coronavirus.

Since Jan 24, MOM officers have been in regular contact with dormitory operators to brief them on the current situation and the precautionary measures to take, a ministry spokesperson said in response to queries from CNA. The operators have been tasked to regularly check and monitor their residents, and perform supervised temperature checks on those who had travelled to China in the past 14 days, the spokesperson said. Dormitory operators also have procedures in place to manage residents who are unwell. A resident who falls ill will be brought to the sick bay situated within the facility and given medical attention. Dormitories licensed by MOM are required to have sick bays and contingency plans, the spokesperson said. If there is an infectious disease outbreak, they must be equipped to quarantine workers. \"MOM has also issued an advisory based off the MOH (Ministry of Health) advisory to all dormitories, to be put up prominently so that residents are aware of the preventive steps to take,\" the spokesperson added. Dormitory operator Centurion Corporation, which manages five dormitories with 28,000 beds in Singapore, said that it activated its pandemic management plan over the Chinese New Year weekend. It issued advisories to all employees, put up education posters for its residents and ensured all lodging sites were stocked with personal protection equipment such as surgical masks, thermometers and sanitisers, said a spokesman in response to CNA queries. Residents are being screened for their temperatures - security officers will take the temperatures of those who have travelled overseas in the past 14 days using contactless digital infrared hand-held thermometers before they are allowed to enter the accommodation premises, said the spokesperson. Thermometers will be provided and they will be required to take their temperatures twice a day and report their daily temperature readings for 14 days following their return, the spokesperson added. New and returning residents also have to declare their health and travel history. In addition to the existing sick bays, each dormitory has set aside at least two apartment units comprising at least 32 beds to serve as isolation and quarantine facilities, the spokesperson said. These units have their own kitchen and toilet facilities. The spokesperson added that while the group currently houses close to 27,000 residents, only 1,267 - or less than 5 per cent - of its foreign worker residents are from China. Among the Chinese national residents, 135 are known to have returned home for the Chinese New Year holidays. A Keppel spokesperson said that Keppel Housing has adopted measures that are in line with the advisory issued by MOM for dormitory operators, which includes closely monitoring the health of residents who have been in China in the last 14 days. According to the MOM website, there are 45 licensed foreign worker dormitories in Singapore. On Jan 26, the Building and Construction Authority released an advisory for contractors and other employers in the built environment sector on how to safeguard their employees\u2019 health. The number of cases of those with the coronavirus in Singapore rose to 10 on Wednesday evening. So far, all cases are Chinese nationals from Wuhan.","summary":"SINGAPORE: Foreign worker dormitory operators have taken steps to help residents minimise the risk of getting infected by the the Wuhan virus following recommendations from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).

Speaking to reporters at the sideline of a cabinet meeting on Tuesday (Jan 28), Dr Putranto said his ministry is readying 100 hospitals across the country should the virus spread to Indonesia. The hospitals, he said, have dedicated wings to isolate patients. \u201cIf there is an escalation, we will make sure we are equipped to handle it. A hundred hospitals are more than enough at this stage. Everyone is ready. We have checked their readiness,\u201d the minister said. There has been no confirmed case of coronavirus infection in Indonesia. Mr Putranto said those who felt ill have been examined and healthcare workers will continue to monitor them. He said some have also been quarantined. \"All (steps) have been taken to make sure that there is no outbreak (in Indonesia),\u201d he stated. \u201cI believe that if we pray together we shall be spared by the outbreak.\u201d More than 130 people have been killed in the outbreak, while the total number of confirmed cases in China stands at more than 5,900. None of the deaths has been outside China and nearly all were in Wuhan, where the virus emerged last month, probably from illegally traded wildlife. The virus has already spread to more than 15 countries, including Singapore with seven confirmed cases. There is heightened concern that the virus might spread to Indonesia. Dismissing what some have characterised as complacency in terms of pandemic preparedness, Dr Putranto said health workers have been deployed to international airports, seaports and land borders to monitor people\u2019s health. He also called on other countries to screen their travellers before they depart. \u201cNo country will allow its citizens (to travel) from the impacted areas without checking first. Everyone understands their responsibility.\u201d He noted that China is issuing medical clearance for its citizens travelling abroad. \"(However), the other day there were seven in Manado (North Sulawesi province) who had not been cleared to fly by China. We temporarily isolated them, our doctors checked them, they were cleared (to enter Indonesia),\u201d he said. The minister also appeared to downplay the seriousness of the viral strain, saying that patients are known to heal on their own. He said that people needed to stay fit to stop themselves from getting infected. \u201cPeople can heal on their own. That is why the most important thing is to keep our body\u2019s immune system high,\u201d he said, adding that the last thing the government wants is to create panic. \u201cIf our immune system is disturbed because of stress and so on, our immune system will drop,\u201d the minister said. \u201cI think our guidelines on maintaining a healthy lifestyle is enough. You can read (the guidelines) at (the ministry\u2019s) website, download and share it\u201d. Last week, a Chinese national working for Huawei\u2019s office in Jakarta had to be rushed to a hospital, sparking fears of community transmission. Offices at the two towers immediately told their employees to wear masks and keep away from the floors that Huawei is occupying. Several hours later, the authorities said the man had merely suffered a throat infection. But some were sceptical that the man had been thoroughly examined, given the short time before authorities dismissed suspicion that he may have contracted the virus. Health officials said the man\u2019s condition improved during his medical observation, an indication that he did not have the virus. Indonesians have expressed concern on social media over what they perceive as inadequate preparations for an outbreak, as well as potentials flaws in the overall system. One Indonesian man said he is sceptical of the government\u2019s seriousness in detecting the presence of the virus.

Dr Adib Khumaidi, the deputy chairman of the Indonesian Doctors Association said several measures put in place during the avian flu epidemic between 2003 and 2007 should be resurrected. He noted that coronavirus has a long incubation period. When travellers enter Indonesia, they might not have fever at that point. It is therefore important is to create a form for them, so that it will facilitate subsequent contact tracing if any, he said, pointing out that this had been put in place during the avian flu outbreak. Dr Khumaidi said the government also needs to engage with doctors outside the 100 hospitals that have been identified to handle the potential outbreak. \u201cThese 100 hospitals need to develop their networks and reach out to other hospitals and clinics,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a patient is sick, they will seek help from the nearest hospital. These hospitals don\u2019t have a system for coronavirus. The government must establish this system and communicate with all hospitals so hospitals know where to send their patients. \u201cDoctors want to support the government\u2019s effort. But they haven\u2019t been well informed and don\u2019t know what to do if they suspect a patient has contracted coronavirus.\u201d There have also been calls for the government to evacuate citizens from Wuhan, especially after the United States and Japan have done so despite the city is being locked down by Chinese authorities. Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mdm Retno Marsudi said there are 243 Indonesians living in the 15 cities which are under lock down, 100 of which are in Wuhan. Almost all of them are students. \u201cWe are in constant communication with them to make sure they are well and thank God they are well,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cWe are opening the possibility of an evacuation.

But authorities could do better to ensure communications are empathetic and responsive, says NMP Professor Lim Sun Sun. SINGAPORE: In as much as the Wuhan virus is a challenge for our medical facilities, it is also proving to be a trying test of our communication infrastructure. When SARS reared its head in 2003 and cast a gloomy pall over Singapore, the situation was significantly different but presented critical lessons for us as we now race to manage the fallout from the Wuhan virus. Seventeen years ago, our media landscape was vastly more manageable than the cacophonous environment we inhabit today. Smartphones were yet to be invented, and social media was but a fledgling phenomenon. The position of trusted and long-established news providers was still strong, albeit challenged by the rise of alternative online media outlets. The public relied principally on news purveyors that practised gatekeeping measures and were held to professional best practices of authentication and verification. During SARS, public communication from the government and businesses was conveyed mainly through press releases and media coverage. Most importantly, in 2003, the ordinary person did not wield the communicative power then as they do now. Whereas we can share information through multiple social media and messaging platforms more easily and swiftly today, this rapid propagation of news and information was previously the exclusive preserve of media companies. The democratisation of media production and dissemination we currently enjoy has heralded a lively but rambunctious world where official communication fights with user-generated tweets, memes and videos for eyeballs. It is in precisely such a climate that misinformation and disinformation about an unfolding crisis thrive. Already, we have seen a proliferation of rumours and online falsehoods misleading the public on the Wuhan virus, including accounts of miraculous recoveries and reports that someone in Singapore had already died from the disease. Thankfully, the latter was swiftly dealt a blow from the office administering the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA). More egregiously, hate speech that demonises people from China or wild allegations about the disease emerging from a systematic bio-terrorism programme seem to be spreading more rapidly than the disease itself. Such falsehoods only serve to stoke racism and xenophobia, needlessly straining our social fabric. With their sensationalist and inflammatory nature that tap into people\u2019s innate fear of the unknown, these falsehoods possess an alarming potency, coursing through social networks much like a contagion does. In a fast-evolving crisis where we need voices of authority to provide clarity, navigating such a chaotic media milieu is tantamount to steering a dinghy through stormy waters. In Singapore, some positive steps have helped to lend calm to a precarious situation. The convening of a high-level press conference involving ministers from a swathe of key ministries signalled the severity of the problem and the seriousness with which it is being tackled. That it was held on a public holiday further underlined the urgency of the situation. These high-profile efforts were accompanied by the launch of a gov.sg WhatsApp subscription for people to request updates on the virus and a Ministry of Health website dedicated to providing the same. Such initiatives are valuable because they target people on platforms they are comfortable with and active on, drawing them in as potential allies in the fight against falsehoods. However, the low frequency of posts on the gov.sg WhatsApp account, and the clinical way with which the information is presented \u2014 as standard text messages - fails to give the accurate information they are sharing the traction that it needs. In a media environment replete with attractively packaged falsehoods, official voices must work harder and smarter to seize the audience\u2019s already limited attention. If official advisories are not accompanied by eye-catching infographics and tip sheets, such critical information will not attain the virality it needs to ensure that people take sensible precautions.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Essential information must be packaged so that people will liberally share and disseminate them, as willingly as they do hoaxes and urban legends. For senior citizens who have a fondness for sharing videos via WhatsApp, short and snappy videos in multiple languages should be produced to explain the protective steps individuals can take. Some may recall that considerable effort was poured into public communication after SARS was declared a national emergency, an experience which is highly instructive. A SARS rap and SARS song were aired on television, while cartoons and accessible language were used in posters, pamphlets and newspaper infomercials, thus adding to their reach. Above all, official communication must exude empathy. Sociologists have long identified and lauded human beings\u2019 unique ability to see things from another person\u2019s perspective. When political leaders and government officials acknowledge people\u2019s anxieties and apprehensions, while prescribing the appropriate course of action, their voices will ring louder and clearer. For example, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong struck the right note in his latest Facebook post by recognising people\u2019s concerns before he explained prudential measures and cautioned against succumbing to rumours and hearsay. In anxious climes, a compassionate voice is a much more persuasive one. Mechanically dispensed advice is no match for falsehoods born out of clever social engineering that exploits people\u2019s cognitive biases and human foibles. Effective crisis communication must thus be empathetic, responsive and timely to quell worries and boost confidence. Furthermore, a proactive communication approach will help to avert speculation and fear-mongering. In our prevailing reality, information is vulnerable to the dynamics of social media and communicators must both confront and ride this beast. Unless there is strategy and sensitivity in crisis communication during such troubled times, our populace will fall prey to conjecture, confusion, and conspiracies.

The results reflected the approach of Chief Executive Satya Nadella, who for five years has re-centered Microsoft around the cloud, renting out its computing power and technology to large businesses. Microsoft said Azure, its primary competitor to Amazon's cloud, grew 62per cent in the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, down from a 76per cent revenue growth rate the year before but up from 59per cent in the fiscal first quarter. Microsoft's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said increased consumption of Azure services, which include offerings such as computing power to run applications and data storage services, drove the revenue growth. \"We did have good usage, which matters a ton to that number,\" Hood told Reuters. \"The core thing that we focused on - which is consumption growth - was quite good.\" Microsoft said revenue for its \"commercial cloud\" - a combination of Azure and the cloud-based versions of software such as Office - reached US$12.5 billion, up from US$9 billion the year before. The commercial cloud gross profit margin - a key measure of cloud profitability that Microsoft has told investors it expects to improve - was 67per cent, versus 62per cent the year before. Microsoft shares rose as much as 4.58per cent to US$175.74 in after-hours trading. \"This quarter was an absolute 'blow out quarter' across the board with no blemishes and in our opinion speaks to an inflection point in deal flow as more enterprises pick Redmond for the cloud,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note, referring to Microsoft's headquarters location in Redmond, Washington. Hood said the company was working to improve margins on its core Azure services, which rely on data centers that can cost billions of dollars to build. She cited \"hardware improvements and taking advantage of those hardware improvements.\" Microsoft's revenue and profit for the second quarter were US$36.9 billion and US$1.51 per share, respectively, compared with analyst estimates of US$35.7 billion and US$1.32 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Microsoft has focused on hybrid cloud computing \u2013 in which a business can use a mix of Microsoft\u2019s data centers and its own \u2013 as well as on delivering its longstanding productivity programs such as Office via the cloud. The shift to the cloud has driven Microsoft's shares up more than 50per cent in the past year, as it gains ground against market leader Amazon and also parries the threats to its classic software programs from newer entrants like Alphabet Inc\u2019s  Google. In 2019, Microsoft had 22per cent share of the cloud computing infrastructure market, compared with 45per cent at Amazon and 5per cent from Google, according to data from Forrester Research. \"Azure\u2019s renewed growth doesn\u2019t yet pose a threat to AWS\u2019s supremacy in the cloud market, but it does present an opportunity to further close the gap on Amazon and increase its lead over other cloud providers,\" said Andrew MacMillen of Nucleus Research. The company\u2019s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure, reported revenue that rose 27per cent to US$11.9 billion in the quarter, versus expectations of US$11.4 billion. For the fiscal third quarter ending in March, Microsoft forecast revenue with a midpoint of US$11.9 billion for the unit, compared with analyst expectations of US$11.4 billion. Its Productivity and Business Process unit, which contains the LinkedIn social network, reported US$11.8 billion in revenue compared with estimates of US$11.4 billion. Revenue in the unit that contains Windows was US$13.2 billion, compared with estimates of US$12.8 billion. Over the past year, Windows sales were hampered by shortages of PC chips from Intel Corp , but the chipmaker said last week it had alleviated most of those supply concerns. Microsoft forecast revenue of between US$10.75 billion and US$11.15 billion for the unit containing Windows in the fiscal third quarter, a wider-than-normal forecast range that the company said was because of uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus in China.","summary":"Microsoft Corp  on Wednesday reported quarterly sales and profit that beat Wall Street expectations, driven by the first acceleration of Azure cloud computing revenue growth in eight quarters amid a pitched battle with Amazon.com Inc\u2019s  cloud unit.

The three people arrived in Japan on Wednesday, on the first flight to evacuate Japanese citizens from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of a deadly outbreak that has killed 170 people and infected thousands. Two of the three had not shown any symptoms, the ministry said, according to NHK. The three evacuees raise the number of cases in Japan so far to 11, including two people who appear to have contracted the virus without travelling to China. \"In addition to the eight cases, among the people who returned from Wuhan yesterday, infection (with the new coronavirus) has been confirmed in one person with symptoms and two other people who have no symptoms,\" Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told lawmakers that the three returnees would be treated in a special medical facility. A total of 206 Japanese citizens landed at Tokyo's Haneda airport on Wednesday morning, with health professionals carrying out checks on board and at the airport, but no mandatory quarantine was planned. A second chartered flight with Japanese evacuees from Wuhan, which is under virtual lockdown, landed in Japan on Thursday with nine people showing symptoms of fever or coughing, broadcaster NHK report. At least one more chartered flight is expected in the coming days. The new cases come after authorities on Wednesday confirmed a second case involving someone who had not recently travelled to China. The woman was a tour guide who worked on the same bus as a driver who also contracted the virus without travelling to China. The driver told authorities he had driven two groups of tourists from Wuhan earlier in January and developed symptoms afterwards. \"The eighth case is the second suspected incident of human-to-human transmission in Japan,\" Kato said. \"We are in a truly new situation.\" Foreign governments have been flying their citizens out of the area, as the number of deaths jumped and the World Health Organization has voiced \"grave concern\" about person-to-person spread in three other countries. The United States flew about 200 Americans out of Wuhan. They were being screened on arrival in California. France, Britain and Canada also have organised evacuations. More than 50 million people have been locked down in and around Wuhan, the central industrial city where the outbreak first began, in a bid by authorities to stop an infection that has since spread to other cities in China and to other countries. While some experts believe the new strain, known as \"2019-nCoV\", is not as deadly as SARS, alarm has grown over its rapid spread and many unknown attributes, such as how lethal it is. The effects of the virus are already weighing heavily on China's economy, the world's second-biggest, with companies cutting corporate travel and tourists cancelling trips. Various airlines are cutting flights, from British Airways and Lufthansa to Air Canada and American Airlines.","summary":"TOKYO: Three Japanese citizens among more than 200 evacuated from China have tested positive for the new coronavirus, Japan's health minister said Thursday (Jan 30).

The cautiously optimistic outlook from the world's biggest memory chip and smartphone maker draws a line under its worst year since 2015. It also echoes positive guidance from peers like Intel Corp and TSMC, signalling a rebound in chip prices after a lengthy slide. The South Korean conglomerate reported operating profit of 7.16 trillion won (US$6.13 billion), down 34 per cent and in line with its own previous estimate. Net profit fell 38 per cent to 5.2 trillion won, with revenue easing 1 per cent to 59.9 trillion won - also meeting estimates. \"Looking ahead to 2020, Samsung expects improvements in overall business performance but also sees continued uncertainties in the global business environment,\" Samsung said in a statement. It didn't identify particular issues that could affect its operations. The United States and China reached an initial deal late last year to resolve a long-running trade row that had disrupted global business, though some issues remain unresolved. Samsung rival Apple Inc earlier this week used a wider-than-normal prediction range for a revenue forecast citing uncertainty created by the coronavirus outbreak in China which economists fear could hurt the global economy. For first-quarter 2020, Samsung said it expected earnings to fall reflecting low seasonal demand. Fourth-quarter operating profit more than halved to 3.45 trillion won in Samsung's mainstay chip division, while mobile division profit improved nearly 67 per cent to 2.52 trillion won. Samsung said the pace of 5G smartphone expansion and its effects should be monitored closely, but the company sees demand picking up around mass-market models as major manufacturers expand their 5G lineups. Shares fell 1.4 per cent by 0125 GMT, trailing the wider market's 0.6 per cent drop. Samsung shares rallied 44 per cent last year, as expectations of an easing of US-China trade tensions fuelled hope of a rebound in the chip industry.","summary":"SEOUL: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Thursday (Jan 30) it expects earnings to bounce back in 2020 after a fourth-quarter slump, helped by a gradual recovery in memory chip demand from data centre customers and 5G smartphone makers.

The group, mostly US diplomats and their families, were evacuated from Wuhan at the epicentre of the outbreak aboard a US government-chartered plane that stopped to refuel in Alaska on Tuesday night before flying on to March Air Reserve Base, about 60 miles (97km) east of Los Angeles. Foreign governments have begun flying their citizens out of Wuhan, as the death toll has risen and the city has entered into a virtual quarantine, with Chinese authorities trying to contain the virus. The 195 passengers at March air base were medically screened by Chinese government and US State Department officials before boarding the plane in Wuhan, and again in Alaska by a team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC officials said. All the passengers have agreed to voluntarily remain in special housing at the military base, cordoned off from base personnel, for 72 hours. \"These people are not under federal quarantine orders,\" said Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. \"I personally talked to them when they were disembarking and going through their first screening checks. They were happy to be here. They were very cooperative with the questions,\" Braden told a news conference at the Riverside University Health System Medical Center, near the base. The US evacuees, who underwent another round of screening on arrival in California, will be given further medical evaluations, including a blood test for exposure to the virus, over the next three days, the officials said. None of the arriving passengers has so far exhibited any symptoms of illness, the officials said. The screening in Alaska included a questionnaire to check for factors that would deem them to have been at high risk of infection, including exposure to someone diagnosed with coronavirus or close contact to someone living with a person who was sick. \"There were no individuals who responded to the questions indicating they were high risk,\" Dr Nancy Knight, director of the CDC's Division of Global Health Protection. \"We are reassessing that now.\" One person on the original evacuation manifest was barred from boarding the plane in China because they had a fever. The plan is to allow the evacuees to return to their homes once the initial evaluation period is over, provided there is no indication of exposure or illness, the officials said. At that point, absent any symptoms or a positive test result, an individual would be considered non-infectious, and would be permitted to travel on public transportation without putting others at any risk, Braden said. People who may be incubating the infection before any symptoms appear are not believed to be contagious, Braden said. However, health authorities will continue \"active monitoring\" of all the passengers through the end of a 14-day incubation period, and plans are in place to isolate any individual who shows signs of illness after they go home. If any evacuees test positive or falls ill in the next three days, they would be transferred to the Riverside Medical Center for isolation and treatment, and authorities would decide what measures need to be taken for the rest of the group, Braden said. Asked if someone in the group who tested negative before the 72-hours hold was over would be free to leave the base early if they wanted, Knight said that would lead to a conversation that \"would be discussed up to the highest levels within the US government,\" Knight said. \"If we think a person is a danger to the community, we can institute an individual quarantine for that person, and we will,\" Braden added. \"If we think it's risky, then we have the tools to protect the public and we will use them.\" So far, five cases of coronavirus have been diagnosed in the United States, none of them fatal, Braden said. A further 165, other than the plane passengers, are under evaluation. \"There's no indication we have any transmission from those cases, and therefore the risk for people in the United State, we believe, is low,\" Braden said.","summary":"LOS ANGELES: Nearly 200 American citizens airlifted from China in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak arrived on Wednesday (Jan 29) at a US military base in California, where they will remain isolated for at least 72 hours of medical evaluation, public health officials said.

While admitting that the estimate is \"imprecise,\" the Chinese team behind a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on Wednesday (Jan 29) said their findings support a 14-day medical observation period for people exposed to the pathogen. The World Health Organization said in an update Monday that the incubation period ranged from between two and 10 days before symptoms like fever, cough, shortness of breath and acute respiratory distress emerged. The incubation period estimate in the new study was based on 10 patients. The researchers also studied the virus's first 425 patients in order to establish two other fundamental characteristics of the outbreak. Since it first emerged in Wuhan in December, the number of cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus doubled every 7.4 days, the researchers wrote. They also estimated that each infected person then infected an average of 2.2 other people, a figure known as the basic reproductive number, or R0 (pronounced \"R-naught\"). The figure doesn't predict how big an epidemic will eventually be, but is a useful measure nonetheless. In this case, it is relatively low: Close to the seasonal flu (around 1.3), much less than the measles (12 or higher) and comparable to the SARS-epidemic of 2002-2003 (3). The team also found that human-to-human transmission had been occurring among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. The Chinese findings echo research by a team in the Netherlands that found an incubation period of 5.8 days, with large variations. And a 27-year-old Vietnamese man who was infected by his father who had travelled to Wuhan showed symptoms in around three days, according to a letter published in NEJM. In the major Chinese study, half of the 425 cases were patients over the age of 60, and none were under 15 years old.","summary":"WASHINGTON: The period between exposure to the new coronavirus that originated in China and symptoms is 5.2 days on average, but varies greatly among patients, according to one of the largest studies yet published on the deadly epidemic.

That was the word Health Minister Gan Kim Yong used on Jan 22 when describing the possibility of an imported case of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore. Singapore is a global transport hub, he reasoned. And the situation in China is constantly evolving, with Thailand then Japan also announcing confirmed cases. It all started at the turn of the new year, when Wuhan in China's central Hubei province announced the outbreak of a cluster of severe pneumonia. More than two weeks later, on the same day Mr Gan spoke to reporters, 17 people in China had died from the new virus, with more than 470 confirmed cases. Mr Gan also announced that he would jointly lead a multi-ministry task force to tackle the spread of the virus in Singapore. After SARS infected 238 and killed 33 people here in 2003, this was serious business. Just a day later, the inevitable happened. Singapore had its first case of the Wuhan virus. On Jan 20, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident flew with his family to Singapore from Guangzhou on a China Southern flight. The next day, he developed a fever and began coughing. When he visited Singapore General Hospital on Jan 22, he was immediately isolated, diagnosed with pneumonia and identified as a suspect case at 10pm. The next evening, he tested positive for the new coronavirus. Singapore had been gearing up for this moment. Initially, authorities implemented temperature screening at Changi Airport only for travellers from Wuhan. This was soon extended to all travellers from China, with those found to have pneumonia and recent travel history to China isolated. In China, authorities locked down Wuhan in an attempt to contain the fast-spreading virus. Scoot, the budget arm of Singapore Airlines, cancelled flights to the city. Before the first case was announced, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong took time out of the annual economic meeting in Davos to give his first public comments on the situation. After the SARS episode, Singapore was better prepared to deal with another outbreak, he reassured. Additional measures came swiftly. Singapore expanded temperature screening to land and sea checkpoints, as authorities braced for a high volume of travel during the Chinese New Year holiday. In the early hours of Jan 24, Mr Lee in his yearly Chinese New Year message said Singaporeans should be calm but watchful. The Government was implementing measures to keep everybody safe and healthy, he added. Later that afternoon, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced two more confirmed cases of the virus: The 37-year-old son of the first case and a 53-year-old woman from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore via a Scoot flight on Jan 21. According to MOH, the woman had visited Orchard Road, Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay, and used public transport like taxis and the MRT. But officials stressed that the risk of transient contact was low. This did not stop Singaporeans from snapping up masks, thermometers and hand sanitisers at pharmacies islandwide, with reports of long queues and empty shelves. MOH, however, said the supply of masks was more than sufficient. Back in Wuhan, anxious foreigners awaited evacuation. People were told to stay at home as public transport had been halted and the healthcare system was overwhelmed. On Jan 25, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was in touch with 35 Singaporeans in Wuhan, stating that they were well. Also that day, Malaysia announced its first three cases of the Wuhan virus, all linked to Singapore's first case. On the evening of Jan 26, Singapore confirmed its fourth case: A 36-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with his family on Jan 22. The next day, the task force announced to a packed press conference that it was ramping up measures to combat the outbreak. This included increased border checks and compulsory leave of absence for students, teachers, healthcare and eldercare workers returning from China. Furthermore, several university hostels, government-linked chalets and the Outward Bound camp on Pulau Ubin were being prepared as quarantine facilities, as authorities anticipated a potential spike in the number of people needing to be isolated. Task force ministers took turns detailing the Government's strategies, including how it plans to ease the potential impact on workers and the economy. They also revealed that officials were working with China to repatriate Singaporeans stuck in Wuhan. National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-leads the task force, said Singapore should be psychologically prepared that the Wuhan virus could be worse than SARS, although he said it was too early to tell how the two compared. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization updated its Wuhan virus risk level to \"very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level\". It admitted that it had incorrectly stated in previous reports that the global risk was \"moderate\". MOH officials highlighted that the ministry was working with healthcare stakeholders to improve its virus testing capabilities, even as scientists around the world scrambled to find a vaccine. Later that evening, Singapore confirmed its fifth case: A 56-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with her family on Jan 18. This comes as the WHO said it was still probing if the virus could spread before symptoms emerged. On Jan 28, Singapore announced its sixth and seventh cases, both Chinese nationals from Wuhan: A 56-year-old and another 35-year-old man who arrived in Singapore on Jan 19 and Jan 23, respectively. The Government had indicated that it was prepared to do more if necessary, with such efforts soon becoming apparent. At the same press briefing, authorities announced that Singapore would stop entry or transit for new visitors who have travelled to Hubei in the last 14 days, as well as holders of Chinese passports issued in Hubei. The country would also suspend new visas being issued for holders of Chinese passports issued in Hubei, as well as previously issued short-term visas and multiple-visit visas. The measures follow similar restrictions in places like Malaysia, Mongolia, Hong Kong and Macau. Social media had been buzzing with discussions, questions and speculation about the virus. Later that evening, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office issued a targeted correction direction to Facebook over two posts claiming that Woodlands MRT station was closed due to the virus. It was the second correction notice issued in relation to the Wuhan virus, following a HardwareZone Forum post claiming that a person in Singapore had died from the virus. Earlier, the Government had stressed the need for swift action against such falsehoods. This is especially as the virus is expected to stick around for some time. Experts warned that the outbreak could last months, as research emerged that the virus could have been present in China since Dec 1, a full month before Wuhan raised the alarm. Global efforts to combat the virus also started to pick up momentum. On Jan 29, the United States announced that it was developing a vaccine for the deadly virus, although the process could take six months before moving to the next phase. Scientists in Australia also said they had successfully developed a lab-grown version of the Wuhan coronavirus, the first to be recreated outside of China, in a breakthrough that could help combat the global spread of the illness. The virus sample would be used to generate an antibody test, allowing detection of the virus in patients who had not shown symptoms, and create a vaccine. Russia also revealed that it was working with China to develop a vaccine, stating that Beijing has handed over the virus genome to rapidly develop express-tests that can identify the virus in the human body within two hours. In the evening of Jan 29, Singapore confirmed its three latest cases, again all Chinese nationals who travelled from Wuhan. The eighth and ninth cases are a married couple \u2013 a 56-year-old woman and 56-year-old man. They arrived in Singapore on Jan 19 and are currently isolated at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). The 10th case is a 56-year-old man who arrived in Singapore on Jan 20. He developed symptoms on Jan 21 and was admitted to NCID a week later, after being identified as a suspect case at a health screening station at Marina South Pier. \"This is consistent with our assessment that more imported cases are expected from Hubei province,\" MOH said, reiterating that there is currently no evidence of community spread in Singapore. With China reporting more cases and deaths as the days go by, and the virus continuing to spread to more countries, the global challenge to contain the virus is self-evident. In Singapore, efforts to deal with the challenge have intensified, with more in the pipeline if necessary. Still, as Mr Lee pointed out in a Facebook post on Jan 26, people have to go about their work and lives, to make sure the country's systems continue to run smoothly and things get done. He said: \"We must remain vigilant and take precautions to protect ourselves, but as the saying goes, Keep Calm and Carry On.\" Full coverage: https:\/\/cna.asia\/wuhan-virus","summary":"That was the word Health Minister Gan Kim Yong used on Jan 22 when describing the possibility of an imported case of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore. It all started at the turn of the new year, when Wuhan in China's central Hubei province announced the outbreak of a cluster of severe pneumonia. More than two weeks later, on the same day Mr Gan spoke to reporters, 17 people in China had died from the new virus, with more than 470 confirmed cases. Mr Gan also announced that he would jointly lead a multi-ministry task force to tackle the spread of the virus in Singapore. On Jan 20, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident flew with his family to Singapore from Guangzhou on a China Southern flight. When he visited Singapore General Hospital on Jan 22, he was immediately isolated, diagnosed with pneumonia and identified as a suspect case at 10pm. In the early hours of Jan 24, Mr Lee in his yearly Chinese New Year message said Singaporeans should be calm but watchful.

SEOUL: Samsung Electronics Co  is counting on a gradual recovery in memory chip demand from data centres and 5G smartphone makers to help it bounce back in 2020 after sliding to its worst operating profit in four years. But in a guarded outlook, the world's biggest memory chip and smartphone maker said on Thursday it couldn't rule out the possibility that demand growth may be curbed amid lingering tensions on U.S.-China trade and looming fears of the economic impact of the new coronavirus outbreak in China and beyond. The conservative forecast failed to satisfy investors hoping for a brighter outlook, and the company's shares ended down 3.2per cent, having fallen as much as 3.9per cent at one point, while the Seoul market benchmark was off 1.7per cent. Samsung, which counts smartphone rivals Apple Inc  and Huawei Technologies Co  as customers for its chips and displays, said fourth-quarter operating profit slumped to 7.16 trillion won (US$6.13 billion) on weaker chip demand, down 34per cent from the same period a year earlier. That was in line with its own estimate, though net profit for the quarter skidded 38per cent to 5.2 trillion won, meaning Samsung missed analysts' estimate of 5.6 trillion won. The October-December quarter marks the end of a year marred by bloated stockpiles of chips that squeezed prices, and the U.S.-China trade war that roiled global supply chains and prospects for consumer demand. For the year, the South Korean conglomerate posted operating profit of 27.8 trillion won, its lowest since 2015. Samsung said it also expected January-March earnings to fall from the preceding quarter, reflecting low seasonal demand for chips and displays. Speaking during a conference call, a Samsung chip executive flagged uncertainties in chip demand. \"The macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns are showing signs of easing recently, but we can't rule out the possibility that the situation would deteriorate,\" said Han Jin-man, senior vice president at Samsung's semiconductor business unit. He didn't identify specific issues that could affect the company. In contrast with Samsung's modest forecast, chip peers like Intel Corp  and TSMC  earlier offered positive outlooks, fuelling hopes of a rebound in chip prices after a slide that started in late 2018. \"Samsung offered a conservative outlook for the memory market, and there is a disconnect between market views and the company views when it comes to strength of the recovery,\" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. Meanwhile, after posting strong results, Apple earlier this week flagged uncertainty created by the coronavirus outbreak in China which economists fear could hurt the global economy. On Thursday Samsung Electronics, which has chip, display and home appliance plants in China, declined to comment on the impact of the outbreak on demand. In a statement to Reuters, it said it had extended a holiday closure for some factories in line with Chinese government guidance. But supplier Samsung SDI , which makes phone batteries and materials for chips and displays, said it expects current-quarter earnings to be adversely affected by the virus outbreak. Fourth-quarter operating profit more than halved to 3.45 trillion won in Samsung's mainstay chip division, while its mobile division profit surged by two-thirds to 2.52 trillion won, thanks to strong sales of flagship models and a revamp of its mid- and lower-end A series line-up. Samsung said the actual pace of 5G network expansion and its effects on memory demand remains to be seen, although the company sees demand picking up around mass-market 5G models. It said it aims to expand its presence in the 5G network equipment market in the United States, while continuing to look at the possibility of entering the European market. This week Britain granted Huawei a limited role in developing the country's 5G mobile network, frustrating a global attempt by the United States to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant from the West's next-generation communications.","summary":"Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  said on Thursday it expects earnings to bounce back in 2020 after a fourth-quarter slump, helped by a gradual recovery in memory chip demand from data centre customers and 5G smartphone makers.

Singapore's annual average overall unemployment rate rose to 2.3 per cent last year from 2.1 per cent in 2018, holding steady in the last three months of the year after trending upwards in the previous quarters, according to preliminary numbers released by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in its Labour Market Report on Thursday (Jan 30). Unemployment for residents increased to 3.2 per cent last year from 2.9 per cent in 2018, while that for Singaporeans stood at 3.3 per cent, up from 3 per cent previously. NTUC assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay said that structural challenges such as skills and jobs mismatches continue to be the main cause of unemployment in Singapore. He said that he is \"eagerly looking forward\" to greater support and funding for Singaporeans in the upcoming Budget, particularly in a challenging climate. \"With the current and impending challenges such as our demographic\/labour force profile, global issues such as the US-China trade war, Brexit and increasing protectionism, technological disruption, the Wuhan virus etc, (I) am eagerly looking forward to greater support, funding and focus in the areas of jobs and skills for Singaporeans,\" said Mr Tay. \"The support should come in various forms and ways targeted at both workers (especially mature workers and PMEs) and employers (SMEs included) so that we can be best poised to confront, overcome and ride the wave of change and challenges,\" he added. Total employment continued to grow last year despite economic headwinds during the course of the year and the uncertainties that remain ahead, noted MOM in its report. Totaly employment (excluding foreign domestic workers) grew by 16,600 in the October to December quarter, lower than the third quarter of last year (21,700) but higher than a year prior (14,700). This took 2019's total employment growth to 55,200, said MOM. Local employment rose by 26,500 last year, similar to the 27,400 recorded in 2018. Expansion was seen in services industries, but local employment contracted in industries such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, which were affected by the \"softer economic conditions\". \"Similar to the past two decades, local employment grew in tandem with total employment,\" said the ministry. About half of foreign employment growth (excluding foreign domestic workers) was due to an increase in work permit holders working in construction. Excluding construction and foreign domestic workers, foreign employment grew by 14,900 in 2019, slightly lower than 2018's count of 16,300. Retrenchments last year were slightly lower than in 2018. MOM said there were 10,700 retrenchments for the full year, compared with 10,730 in 2018. Retrenchments were higher in manufacturing and services, but lower in construction. In the last quarter, 2,700 people were retrenched, slightly higher than 2,470 in the third quarter and 2,510 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Speaking to the media on Thursday, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo pointed out that while the unemployment rate has inched upwards since the start of 2018, with resident and citizen unemployment rates hovering at around the 3 per cent mark, these numbers are still lower than the 4 to 5 per cent figures seen in the previous decade. \u201cFrom that perspective, the unemployment rates for 2019 are a concern but they are not alarming,\u201d Mrs Teo said. Coupled with \u201cbetter than expected\u201d employment growth and an absence of a spike in retrenchments, the numbers suggest that \u201cthe challenge is not primarily the lack of job creation or jobs being created, but possible job-skills mismatches,\u201d Mrs Teo added. The real median income of full-time employed Singaporeans increased 3.9 per cent annually from 2014 to 2019, \"significantly\" higher than the 2.1 per cent annual growth in the previous five years, said MOM. Over the last five years, real income growth at the 20th percentile rose by 4.6 per cent annually, higher than the 3.9 per cent annual growth at the median. \"This was helped by initiatives to raise the income of low-wage workers in recent years. As a result, their income gap with the median worker narrowed,\" said MOM.","summary":"SINGAPORE: Unemployment rates edged up last year amid economic challenges, in what Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said was a \"concern\" but not \"alarming\".

The first of up to four planned flights to Wuhan had been due to depart South Korea on Thursday morning, but were delayed for unspecified reasons, Yonhap news agency reported. The flights were still expected to depart by later in the day. \"The weapons that will protect us from the new coronavirus are not fear and aversion but trust and cooperation,\" Moon said in a speech on Thursday, decrying \"fake news\" as creating excessive anxiety. Protesters used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centres in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, about 80km south of Seoul, on Wednesday. The government has proposed to keep the evacuated citizens in isolation at the facilities, usually used as training centres for public servants, for at least two weeks to ensure they do not develop symptoms. Moon tried to reassure residents, saying the initial evacuees would only be those with no symptoms, and they will be held in isolation. \"The government will be taking air-tight steps to ensure the residents of areas where the facilities are do not need to be concerned,\" he said. South Korea has reported four cases of the newly identified virus, all of whom arrived after visiting the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the pathogen appeared in humans late last year. The new strain of coronavirus has an incubation of between one and 14 days and can spread before symptoms show, complicating efforts to screen people at international borders. It has created widespread alarm because it is spreading quickly and there are still important unknowns surrounding it, but it is still too early to know what its death rate will be, because there are likely to be many cases of milder infections going undetected. South Korea said the inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong, North Korea, would be closed until the outbreak eased. North Korea would not allow South Korean officials to enter the office when they arrived on Thursday, Yonhap reported, citing South Korea's unification ministry.","summary":"SEOUL: South Korean President Moon Jae-in urged residents not to give in to fear as the country prepared to evacuate the first of around 700 citizens from the epicentre of the new coronavirus epidemic in China on Thursday (Jan 30).

Separately, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong told reporters that some Singaporeans are unable to come back because they are already symptomatic. He said it was \"not safe\" for them to be on the same plane as the 92 Singaporeans who returned home on Thursday morning. \"But in any case, I think the vast majority of them are already back, and they are not symptomatic, but to be safe, all of them will be subject to quarantine,\" Mr Wong added. \"The ones who are remaining ... our embassy is in touch with all of them, to ensure their welfare, to ensure that they're okay. \"Some are symptomatic and they may well have to stay quarantined in China itself, but we are in touch with all of them. \"I don't have the numbers off hand but there are not that many \u2013 vast majority are already back.\" Scoot had suspended its Singapore-Wuhan return flights from Jan 23 to Mar 29, after Chinese authorities locked down the Hubei province. The airline had organised a flight from Singapore to Wuhan on Wednesday night to fly back some of the passengers who wanted to return to Wuhan but were affected by the cancellations. The flight landed in Wuhan Tianhe International Airport at about 3am on Thursday. MFA consular officers accompanied the flight to \"facilitate the ground operations at Wuhan\", the ministry said. To ensure the safety of employees and passengers, temperature screening was conducted at check-in and before boarding, said Scoot in a statement. \"Any passengers found to be febrile would not have been allowed to board,\" said Scoot. Surgical masks were provided to all passengers and all operating crew members were required to wear N95 masks and surgical flights on board the flights. The flight operated with \"limited in-flight service\", with no distribution of food and drink or sale of duty-free products. Food packs were pre-placed on the seats, said the airline. \"This greatly limited the physical interactions between passengers and crew,\" it said. The aircraft was disinfected in Wuhan before passengers boarded the flight home, and the plane was again disinfected upon arrival in Singapore. MFA said the returning Singaporeans will undergo medical screening when they arrive at Changi Airport. Those with fever or respiratory symptoms will be taken to designated hospitals for further examination, while the remaining passengers - including the consular officers - will be quarantined for 14 days.

The return of the 92 Singaporeans on Thursday comes as the death toll from the coronavirus hit 170 in China, with more than 7,700 people infected in the country. The vast majority of these cases were in the Hubei province, where the first cases of the virus were reported. Foreign governments have been flying their citizens out of the area, as the number of deaths jumped and the World Health Organization voiced \"grave concern\" about person-to-person spread in three other countries. In Singapore, 10 people are confirmed to have the coronavirus so far, with the latest three cases announced on Wednesday. The authorities have announced measures to contain the virus, including restrictions on visitors who have travelled to Hubei recently and visitors who hold passports issued in Hubei province. They have also implemented temperature screening for all incoming flights and a compulsory leave of absence for students and teachers returning from China.","summary":"SINGAPORE: Ninety-two Singaporeans arrived home from Wuhan, the epicentre of a virus outbreak, on Thursday (Jan 30) morning. \"Ninety-two Singaporeans will arrive in Singapore from Wuhan, Hubei via Scoot flight TR121 this morning,\" said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a press statement on Thursday.

The masks \u2013 a pack of four sealed in a bag \u2013 will be made available progressively at 89 Community Centres (CCs) and 654 Residents' Committee (RC) centres. Collection will start on Feb 1 and is expected to be completed by Feb 9. Mr Wong said the distribution is a \"one-time exercise\" where masks from Singapore\u2019s national stockpile are being released directly to the public. \u201cWe are doing this to assure Singaporeans that every family will have access to masks if someone in your family really needs it,\u201d he added. Priority for the stockpile will be given to healthcare workers at the frontline. For public distribution, priority will be given to areas with high numbers of vulnerable residents as well as rental block residents and Pioneer Generation residents. For residents who are not able to collect the masks themselves, the People's Association will mobilise volunteers to send the masks to them, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing, who is deputy chairman of the People's Association. Subsequent needs for additional masks will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, he added. The move to distribute masks came after long queues and empty shelves for face masks were seen at retailers islandwide. Mr Chan said 5 million masks have been released to retailers in the past nine days, but the usage has been much higher than expected. \"We understand when people are fearful there is a tendency for them to panic buy or hoard,\" he said. But not managing the usage \u201cwill jeopardise our entire healthcare system, not allowing us to take care of those who need it the most\u201d. While most Singaporeans are staying calm, some have taken to hoarding masks, said Mr Chan. \"Such behaviour - they are not appropriate, they are selfish and they are not helpful to our collective defence,\" he said. The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) will pack the masks and deliver them to the CCs, where the People's Association will distribute them to the public. It will take seven days to pack the masks, with about 200,000 expected to be packed each day.

WASHINGTON: The U.S. economy missed the Trump administration's 3per cent growth target for a second straight year, posting its slowest annual growth in three years in 2019 as the slump in business investment deepened amid damaging trade tensions. The economy grew 2.3per cent last year, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. That was the slowest since 2016 and followed the 2.9per cent notched in 2018. The 3per cent growth target has remained elusive despite the White House and Republicans' US$1.5 trillion tax cut package, which President Donald Trump had predicted would lift growth persistently above that target. The department's snapshot of gross domestic product, however, showed the economy maintaining a moderate pace of growth in the fourth quarter, thanks to a smaller import bill. The report suggested the Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts in 2019 helped to keep the longest expansion in history, now in its 11th year, on track and avert a downturn. It followed on the heels of the Fed deciding to keep rates unchanged. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday the U.S. central bank expected \"moderate economic growth to continue\" but also nodded to some risks, including the recent coronavirus outbreak in China. The Trump administration's 18-month-long trade war with China last year fueled fears of a recession. Though the economic outlook has improved with this month's signing of a Phase 1 deal with Beijing, economists do not see a boost to the economy as U.S. tariffs remained in effect on US$360 billion of Chinese imports, about two-thirds of the total. Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1per cent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, matching the third-quarter pace, as lower borrowing costs encouraged purchases of motor vehicles, houses and other big-ticket items. Growth was also lifted by increased government spending. That helped to offset the drag from a slower pace of inventory accumulation. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 2.1per cent rate in the fourth quarter. Excluding trade, inventories and government spending, the economy grew at a 1.4per cent rate in the fourth quarter, the slowest in four years. This measure of domestic demand rose at a 2.3per cent pace in the third quarter. Economists estimate the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation at around 1.8per cent. The White House claimed that slashing the corporate tax rate to 21per cent from 35per cent, as well as shrinking the trade deficit would boost annual GDP growth to 3.0per cent on an sustainable basis. Economists have long disagreed, pointing to structural issues like low productivity and population growth. Some also argued that there was historically not a very strong relationship between corporate tax rates and business investment. Business investment fell at 1.5per cent rate in the fourth quarter. It was the third straight quarterly decline and the longest such stretch since 2009. There were decreases last quarter in spending on nonresidential structures and business equipment. Trade tensions have eroded business confidence and weighed on capital expenditure. With confidence among chief executive officers remaining low in the fourth quarter after dropping to a 10-year low in the prior quarter, a rebound is unlikely soon. Business investment is also seen pressured by Boeing's suspension this month of the production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, which was grounded last March following two fatal crashes. Boeing on Wednesday reported its first annual loss since 1997. Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slowed to a 1.8per cent pace after rising at a brisk 3.2per cent rate in the third quarter. A decrease in imports in the fourth quarter, in part because of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, compressed the trade deficit. Trade added 1.48 percentage points to fourth-quarter GDP growth. But the decline in imports in the fourth quarter resulted in businesses almost depleting inventories in warehouses. A 40-day strike at General Motors also weighed on motor vehicle inventories. Inventories rose at a US$6.5 billion rate in the fourth quarter, the smallest gain since the second quarter of 2018, after increasing at a US$69.4 billion pace in the July-September quarter. Inventory investment chopped 1.09 percentage points from GDP growth last quarter.","summary":"The U.S. economy missed the Trump administration's 3per cent growth target for a second straight year, posting its slowest annual growth in three years in 2019 as the slump in business investment deepened amid damaging trade tensions.

There have been long queues and empty shelves at several retail outlets islandwide since at least Jan 24, when the second and third cases were confirmed, with shoppers snapping up masks, thermometers and hand sanitisers. \"I understand many Singaporeans are concerned whether we have sufficient masks in our stockpile,\" said Mr Chan. \"Whether we have sufficient masks or not will depend on three factors: How much we have in our physical stockpile, our usage rate, and our resupply quantum and frequency. \"We will have enough if we manage these three factors appropriately,\" he added. Should personal mask usage not be managed, the entire healthcare system could be \"jeopardised\", said Mr Chan. This would \"not allow\" the government to \"take care of those who need it the most\u201d, he added. The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) has released 5 million masks to retailers in the past nine days, but the usage has been much higher than expected. To ensure mask availability, it plans to source for new suppliers and ramp up purchases for traditional sellers. \"So far, the usage rate in the last one week has been much higher than what would be reasonably expected,\" said Mr Chan. \"But we understand when people are fearful there is a tendency for them to panic buy or to hoard, but this is not useful to the entire system.\" He also cautioned that many producers are prioritising supply to China because it is the epicentre of the virus outbreak. Supply is also further constrained because certain places, such as Taiwan, have banned the export of surgical masks, he added. Demand is also coming from other parts of the world who also have healthcare needs, such as the Philippines and bushfire-stricken Australia. Going forward, Singapore will prioritise the resupply of masks to medical institutions. \"While we manage our stockpile we must also manage our usage rate to prioritise those who need it the most: The healthcare workers, the vulnerable ones,\" said the minister. People should \"only use it when we are going to seek medical help when we are not well\", he added. \"Prepare for the long haul but never, never succumb to the short-term fears and panic buying and hoarding behaviours, because this will destroy the entire system that we have,\" Mr Chan stressed. While the \"vast majority of Singaporeans are staying calm\", he noted that \"some in the local community that have taken to hoarding the supplies\" of masks. \"Such behaviour - they are not appropriate, they are selfish and they are not helpful to our collective defence,\" said Mr Chan. \"We must all act in unison, act together, and not jeopardise the entire system by doing things that we think might benefit ourselves, protect ourselves, but to detriment of everyone else in the society.\" To ensure that all Singaporeans have access to masks \"when they require them\", the Ministry of Defence will be distributing four masks to each household. Retailers profiteering from the situation will be taken to task, said Mr Chan, adding that warning letters will be sent to errant sellers. He called out retailer Deen Express, which is suspected of profiteering by selling masks at high prices, saying that they will be required to explain the basis of the prices set, the cost price of their mask and their reasons for doing so. It is \"wrong for the resellers to try to take advantage of this situation to profiteer\", he said. \"We will not allow this to happen.\" \"We do not stand for such (profiteering) behaviour in Singapore, and we also urge Singaporeans not to support or give in to such profiteers because we do have our means to provide the necessary supplies,\" said Mr Chan. He applauded efforts by e-commerce platforms such as Qoo10 and Carousell to weed out such profiteering, and said that they will be asked to cooperate with the ministry and provide information on errant sellers.","summary":"SINGAPORE: Singapore will have enough masks for its residents provided they are managed \"appropriately\", said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Thursday (Jan 30), amid concerns over the availability of masks as protection against the deadly Wuhan virus. \"I understand many Singaporeans are concerned whether we have sufficient masks in our stockpile,\" said Mr Chan.

WASHINGTON\/TOKYO: A rapidly spreading virus outbreak in China is emerging as a potentially major new risk to the global economy and leaving policymakers, still grappling with the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war, fretting over the widening fallout. The potential effects of the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed 170 in China since its detection early last month, took center stage in U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's news conference on Wednesday. \"China's economy is very important in the global economy now, and when China's economy slows down we do feel that - not as much though as countries that are near China, or that trade more actively with China, like some of the Western European countries,\" Powell said. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also voiced concern on Thursday over the potential damage to Japan's economy, which is heavily reliant on China as a production and market base. \"I would like to scrutinize the economic impact, including that from the hit to tourism,\" Abe told parliament. Zhang Ming, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think tank, projected the outbreak would cut China's first-quarter growth by one percentage point to 5per cent or lower. China has imposed travel restrictions and shut businesses to contain the outbreak, but has not quelled rising concern among companies and governments across the world, some of whom are taking swift action. A plane of Japanese evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, arrived in Tokyo on Thursday. New Zealand and Indonesia are also preparing to evacuate their citizens. Airlines including British Airways , United Airlines  and Lufthansa  are cutting or suspending flights. Starbucks  has closed more than half its cafes in China and Walt Disney  shut its resorts and theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong. \"Apart from the risk to human lives, it is likely to hit travel and consumption activities. In a scenario of widespread infection, it could materially weaken economic growth and fiscal positions of governments in Asia,\" S&P said on Thursday. Asian stocks sank on Thursday as the death toll from the virus rose and more cases were reported around the world. Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries also hit a three-month low of 1.5600per cent as investors sought the safety of government bonds. \"We expect the risk of potential negative spillovers to domestic tourism in neighboring countries to be higher than during SARS because Chinese nationals now make up the largest share of visitors to other Asia-Pacific economies,\" Moody's said on Wednesday. \"The timing is particularly bad for Japan as it seeks to rebound from the dip in consumption, and presumably real GDP growth, in the last quarter of 2019 following a sales tax hike.

Many say the impact on global growth could be bigger this time, as China now accounts for a larger share of the world economy. The fallout from the epidemic casts a shadow over the Bank of Japan's projection that global growth will pick up around mid-year and help Japan's economy sustain a moderate recovery. China is Japan's second-largest export destination. The Chinese make up 30per cent of all tourists visiting Japan and nearly 40per cent of the total sum foreign tourists spent last year, an industry survey showed.","summary":"A rapidly spreading virus outbreak in China is emerging as a potentially major new risk to the global economy and leaving policymakers, still grappling with the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war, fretting over the widening fallout.

SYDNEY: The Wuhan coronavirus has had a significant human toll. About 170 people have died and more than 7,800 are known to be infected. The number actually infected will be higher. People experiencing only mild symptoms often don\u2019t report them. The economic cost is as hard to tease out as the health cost, but there are clues. They suggest the coronavirus will have little impact on the global economy, quite a bit in China, and some in Australia, which will most likely be short-lived. The impact in China is already apparent, with 35 million people under effective lockdown, air travel curtailed, and some tourist destinations closed. In a sign the virus might spread, five million people reportedly left Wuhan before the lockdown. The Shenzhen and Shanghai composite stock market indexes fell 3.52 per cent and 2.75 per cent before they closed for what turned out to be an extended Lunar New Year break. While China\u2019s steps to contain the coronavirus will hurt its economy in the short term, in longer term, they might contain the damage. The world has changed significantly since the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, the Asian Flu pandemic of 1957 to 1958 and even the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic of 2002 to 2004. On one hand the world has become better at containment and treatment; on the other, it has become more connected. But previous pandemics can tell us a lot. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Spanish Flu hit 500 million people worldwide, killing as many as 50 million worldwide, including 675,000 in the United States. The US Congressional Budget Office believes such an event in 2006 would have cut US gross domestic product 4.25 per cent below where it would have been. World Bank calculations suggest a severe pandemic, killing 71 million people, would cut world GDP by about 5 per cent. The 1957 pandemic killed about 1.1 million people worldwide. A follow-up 1968 pandemic had a similar effect. The Congressional Budget Office believes a recurrence would cut United States GDP to about 1 per cent below where it would have been. Similar countries would be affected in a similar way. The World Bank believes such a scenario would cut world GDP by between 1 per cent and 2 per cent. According to the US CDC, SARS infected around 8,100 people, with 774 dying, which was a 9.4 per cent mortality rate. Its economic impact is open to debate. SARS mainly affected mainland China and Hong Kong, with one study estimating it cut their GDPs by 1.1 per cent and 2.6 per cent. But because the event coincided with the recovery from a global recession, the effect is hard to estimate. Other estimates are less pessimistic. The economic impact was limited, with little impact outside of China and Hong Kong, as Australia\u2019s Treasury noted at the time. There are some factors worth considering. First, it\u2019s not yet severe. About 170 people have died so far. The mortality rate hovers around 3 per cent. China has moved aggressively to contain the virus meaning it should have less impact on gross domestic product than earlier pandemics. Second, there\u2019s been minimal global impact. There have been few cases outside China. The countries with few if any reported cases are likely to suffer little impact, as correctly predicted by a Treasury discussion paper on the impact of SARS. Third, China and Hong Kong are the worst hit. The impact is likely to be less than SARS because the coronavirus is less severe, because of China\u2019s forthright containment efforts and because the outbreak has coincided with the Lunar New Year break. However, the aggressive steps taken to contain the virus might have a significant short-term impact. Travel has declined significantly. Tourist attractions, such as Disneyland in China have closed. Wuhan is likely to see a significant economic decline. Fourth, the impact should be short-lived. With SARS, the economies of both China and the rest of the world rebounded shortly afterwards. To some extent, this coincided with the world emerging from an economic downturn. But other estimates suggest that even the impact of the severe 1918 pandemic was short-lived. Fifth, different industries will be impacted differently. In impacted regions, tourism and consumer spending are likely to be the most significantly hit, as was the case in 1918. China has already suffered a significant reduction in travel expenditure. Other industries, including medical industries, will experience positive impacts. But given that the coronavirus is relatively contained, the impact is unlikely to spread to those industries in other countries. Taken together these points suggest the coronavirus is unlikely to significantly affect the world economy. Based on what we know so far, the impact on China is likely to be short-lived. The flow-on effect to countries with a relationship with China is likely to modest and also short-lived. Should infection or mortality rates spike, the impact could worsen.

Nintendo raised its Switch sales forecast for the year ending Mar 31 to 19.5 million units from 18 million units in a previous estimate, and hiked its operating profit forecast by 15 per cent to \u00a5300 billion. Operating profit for the October-December quarter rose 6 per cent to \u00a5168.7 billion (US$1.54 billion), versus \u00a5158.6 billion a year earlier. The quarterly profit was its highest since the same period of 2009, but still came in below an average forecast of \u00a5175 billion from 10 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. The Kyoto-based gaming company sold 12.6 million units of its hybrid home-portable Switch device in the nine months to December and 5.2 million handheld-only Switch Lite units that went on sale in September. Nintendo's release of the lower-priced Switch Lite handheld and two new Pokemon titles - the console's fastest-selling game series - have helped drive momentum in the device's third year as hardware from rivals Sony and Microsoft approaches the end of its lifecycle. Gaming fans have growing opportunities to experience Nintendo's popular roster of characters, from a branded store in Tokyo that has seen long queues, to a Nintendo-themed area due to open in Osaka's Universal Studios Japan park this summer. Nintendo is pushing into mobile gaming with its latest title, a version of its marquee racing series Mario Kart, which was widely downloaded but disappointed fans with its lack of a multiplayer option that is now undergoing testing. Revenues from mobile have topped US$1 billion, analytics firm Sensor Tower estimates, with Nintendo's home market of Japan and role-playing title Fire Emblem Heroes the biggest drivers. The company's expansion includes the start of Switch sales in China in December with partner Tencent Holdings Ltd as it tries to shut down a grey market for its products. With its family-friendly games, Nintendo is seen as having a better chance of receiving approval for its titles from China's regulators. Production in China is seeing some impact from the coronavirus epidemic that has hit the country, CEO Shuntaro Furukawa said at a news briefing.

The government has taken drastic measures to contain the spread of 2019-nCoV since it emerged at the end of December in a market where wild animals were sold. More than 50 million people in and around the epicentre of Wuhan have been confined to their cities, while nationwide travel has been heavily curtailed. Alarmed by daily reports of new cases across the country, ordinary citizens and local officials have buttressed these efforts with their own blockades, fearful that travellers from Hubei will infect their communities. In one Beijing residential compound, a motley stack of shared bicycles have been haphazardly woven together and wired to a wooden ladder, blocking a side gate and forcing visitors to register with guards at the main entrance. Staff at the Zhongfangli complex said the bike barrier was built at the start of the week to help them control the flow of people into the compound and stop the virus spreading to residents inside. Photos of homemade roadblocks elsewhere in China have been shared widely on the microblogging platform Weibo. In one image, a man wearing a surgical mask and brandishing a traditional martial arts weapon squats on a barricade in front of a village. A hand-written sign on the structure reads: \"Outsiders forbidden from entering\". Another shows two elderly men in surgical masks, purportedly in coastal Shandong province, standing behind a cardboard notice instructing visitors to turn around and not enter the community. A truck has been used to block the road into one section of Lianyungang city near Shanghai since Tuesday, a nearby resident said. \"Don't come back once you've left,\" locals were instructed, the 30-year-old told AFP. In nearby Yancheng, a car ambled around apartment blocks blaring a recorded message that warned against contact with arrivals from the epicentre of the outbreak. \"If you discover someone who has returned from Hubei, notify the residents' committee immediately,\" a loudspeaker on the car warned. Numerous residential compounds in Beijing have also asked their inhabitants to report any visitors from Wuhan, the city where the virus first appeared - or simply anyone from out of town. Hotels around China have refused entry to travellers from Hubei province, while people from Wuhan currently in other parts of the country have been the victims of targeted harassment, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). Several Wuhan-based students who returned to their home provinces for the Lunar New Year holiday reportedly saw their personal details leaked and shared in online chat groups. \"I am a university student in Wuhan,\" one student wrote online, according to HRW. \"I promise I will self-quarantine, please do not treat us as enemies.\" In addition to transport restrictions, authorities are rapidly erecting pre-fabricated hospitals in Wuhan to treat infected residents and are monitoring more than 80,000 people for signs they have the virus. Officials also warned Thursday that suspected carriers who refused quarantine or otherwise helped spread the disease would be treated as threats to public safety. But they have taken a dim view of local efforts to stop the spread of the epidemic. On Thursday authorities ordered the removal of unauthorised roadblocks disrupting long-distance travel, saying the barricades threatened to disrupt the supply of agricultural goods. Food prices this week have risen to their highest point in nearly four years, according to a widely-used index of produce costs reported by state news agency Xinhua.","summary":"BEIJING: Villages and apartment complexes across China are taking the fight against a deadly viral epidemic into their own hands with improvised barricades and the online shaming of potentially-infected strangers.

While Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has ordered the suspension of the high-speed rail service between the city and mainland China from midnight on Thursday (Jan 30) and all cross-border ferry services, the unions said it was not enough. \"Front-line colleagues are in a panic as they are exposed to high risk of getting the virus while at work,\" said Railway Power, which represents about 500 workers from metro operator MTR Corp. The Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA) said it welcomed the steps the government had taken but wanted it to close the entire border and would meet on Saturday to discuss what more action it could take. \"There is still a considerable distance from our goal of full-scale preventive measures of infection control,\" the union said in a statement. Chris Cheung, treasurer of the HAEA, which has more than 18,000 members, said many of them planned to begin phased strike action next week unless their demands were met. The former British colony has confirmed 10 cases of the coronavirus, with one person in critical condition. The epicentre of the outbreak is the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where it is believed to have jumped to humans from an animal in an illegal wildlife market. The health scare comes after months of at times violent protests in Hong Kong sparked by fears its autonomy, guaranteed under a \"one country, two systems\" formula, is being eroded by Beijing. Protesters frustrated by the city government's refusal to make concessions on demands for full democracy have in recent months formed about 40 unions as a way to press their campaign and at least a dozen of them have come out in support of the HAEA's proposed strike. Lam has said it is \"inappropriate and impractical\" to close the entire border. The threat of strike action comes as Hong Kong residents have been scouring shops for face masks and joining long queues as supplies dwindle. Berry So, a waiter, said he had queued up from 2am outside one shop. \"I've been waiting six to seven hours,\" said So, who failed to get a mask. China's National Health Commission said on Thursday the total number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus in the country climbed to 170, as the number of infected patients rose to 7,711.","summary":"HONG KONG: Trade unions in Hong Kong, including hospital and rail workers, are threatening to go on strike unless the government closes the border with mainland China to stop the spread of a new coronavirus that has sent jitters around the world.

Speaking at a media interview, Mrs Teo said that there were already headwinds going into 2020 due to rising global conflict and trade tensions that had not been fully resolved. But with growing alarm worldwide over the spread of the Wuhan virus, economic uncertainty has heightened and \"investment decisions are bound to be reexamined\". Yet, while no one knows how long this health crisis will last, it is unlikely that the situation will persist, Mrs Teo said. \u201cIt will not be business as usual because we know businesses have to take more precautions than before, but life must somehow go on, businesses must operate, workers must still be able to go to work,\" she said. She also said that current circumstances are \"significantly different\" than during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic. \u201cWhen you look at SARS, practically everyone was caught by surprise,\u201d she said. There was much that was not unknown and difficulty identifying the strain of coronavirus then. However, after the contagion first broke out in Wuhan, the Chinese government quickly released the genome sequence of the virus. During the SARS outbreak, there was a \"fairly long period of time where it was just ... grappling in the dark\", said Mrs Teo. \"Today it's all about organising the response.\" Singapore\u2019s economy has also diversified significantly since 2003. Tourism and the hospitality sector may still be an important economic growth engine but it is a \u201crelatively modest contributor\u201d, she pointed out. Within the tourism sector, the origin of tourists and reasons they come to Singapore have also become more varied, she added. While the country still attracts recreational visitors, many are here for meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions (MICE)-related activities as well. When asked how the economic outlook will impact the employment status of Singaporeans in the coming months, Mrs Teo said that employers she spoke to are well-aware of the situation and are \u201cmaking every effort to try and carry on with their daily lives and their work\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of everything coming to a standstill, but they are exercising greater caution,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, business deals that involve Chinese contacts ... may moderate a little bit, but they will then look for other opportunities at this time,\u201d she added.

China: France is preparing to airlift hundreds of its citizens from the Chinese city at the centre of a deadly coronavirus outbreak, but one Frenchman is staying put. Philippe Klein is head of the International SOS Hospital in Wuhan, the first city to be locked down by Chinese authorities as they battle the spread of the virus. \"It's not an act of heroism. It's been well thought out, it's my job,\" Klein said of his decision to stay. \"I think I'll be much more useful here than in France.\" The new coronavirus has killed 170 people so far in mainland China, with thousands infected across the country. The virus has been detected in more than a dozen other countries, including as far away as the United States and Canada. Klein told AFP he wants to help the local French community. Some 500 French nationals are registered with the nation's consulate in Wuhan. French auto giant PSA and Renault have factories in the city, and the local universities run exchange programmes with institutions in France. Not all French nationals are leaving - some for professional or family reasons, and others do not want to spend 14 days in quarantine upon their return to France. But Klein, a father of four who has been based in China for six years, recommends they do leave. \"The concern now is that the Chinese hospitals are currently one hundred per cent mobilised in controlling this coronavirus epidemic, so there are lots of ways humans could contract other infections or diseases,\" the Metz native said. \"It would therefore not be appropriate at this time to go to a Chinese hospital under these circumstances. That's why I strongly recommend the French people in Wuhan go back to France.\" The coronavirus has sparked fear of a wider, global outbreak. In addition to controlling the flow of people from affected areas in China, face masks have also been made mandatory in many areas, including Wuhan. Many stores in big cities like Beijing have run out of stock in recent days. But Klein suggests keeping the outbreak in perspective. He says it's important to remember that the flu \"can kill up to 550,000 people on the planet in one season\" in normal times. \"I wear the mask regularly when I go out. It's an obligation imposed by the local authorities, so everyone here in Wuhan is wearing a mask,\" he said. But it is mostly sick people who need to wear the mask, \"so that they don't spread the virus\". \"Psychologically, it's an interesting thing, wearing a mask. Of course, it's reassuring and it probably stops you from putting your hands up to your mouth,\" he added. \"The most important thing is to have good hygiene and wash your hands frequently.\" For Klein, staying in China is his job, and what he has been trained to do. \"I am a virus tamer,\" he says, and staying in China, it is \"as if I was with a lion in its cage\".","summary":"China: France is preparing to airlift hundreds of its citizens from the Chinese city at the centre of a deadly coronavirus outbreak, but one Frenchman is staying put.

NEW DELHI: The deadly coronavirus outbreak in China could start to disrupt India's production of smartphones if it continues to spread in February, industry executives said, as it could delay component shipments. India is the world's biggest smartphone maker after China but is still largely dependent on China for supplies of parts such as cells, display panels, camera modules and printed circuit boards. Taiwan's Foxconn and Wistron make iPhones in India for Apple, and Foxconn produces phones there for China's Xiaomi as well. Other smartphone makers in India include South Korea's Samsung and China's OnePlus. So far smartphone makers in India have weathered the impact of the virus, which has already killed 170 people, partly because they had ramped up inventories of Chinese-made parts anyway to cover the Lunar New Year holiday period when China's factories close down. \"Those disruptions were already planned but if it (the virus' spread) gets prolonged then for March and April production we will have serious trouble,\" said S.N. Rai, the co-founder of homegrown smartphone maker Lava. \"We're definitely worried about it.\" Some components can be shipped in from markets such as South Korea, Vietnam or Taiwan, but smartphone makers will only make such purchases as a \"last resort\" as it would force companies to make changes including in design and software, Rai said. China's OnePlus said its Indian operations could manage, in the short term at least. \"We are well covered because we have the entire production in India, we already have enough stock, and even going forward many of the components will anyway be coming directly from other markets,\" said Vikas Agarwal, the India head of OnePlus. While Beijing has expressed confidence in defeating the \"devil\" virus, which is yet to be declared a global emergency by the World Health Organisation, major companies such as Alphabet Inc's Google and Sweden's IKEA have closed operations in China. India's Tata Motors, which counts China as a major market for its luxury Jaguar Land Rover cars, said on Thursday it was worried about the coronavirus and warned that the outbreak could hit profits. As several airlines suspend flights to China, the movement of technical staff from the country - such as on-site support executives, machine and automation specialists - will also be curtailed and that will hit India's smartphone sector, an executive at another foreign-owned smartphone maker, who did not wish to be named, said.

Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who assumed control of the company in 2009, stressed she was in no rush and that an investor would have to strengthen the business. Last year, the billionaire businesswoman completed consolidating Louis Dreyfus Company Holdings BV (LDHBV) - the structure that holds the family's shares in LDC - via her Akira family trust which now controls over 96 per cent of the holding firm. She has spent a decade negotiating costly and acrimonious buyouts of minority family shareholders, while profits at LDC declined in increasingly tough agricultural markets. \"It is the first time in our almost 170-year history that we are prepared to open our capital to an external shareholder,\" the 57-year-old said in an interview. \"But we are not under pressure. We want to keep majority control. Everything else depends on the quality of offers.\" The group has previously indicated it could bring \"regional players\" into the business to help strengthen its positions in areas where it seeks expansion, such as China. Akira's consolidation of LDC's ownership has come at a cost: it borrowed US$1 billion from Credit Suisse last year to buy out the minority shareholders, pledging its shares in LDC as collateral, its filing showed. Credit Suisse declined to comment. This comes at a time when LDC, like its rivals, faces a challenging business environment - with swine fever in China, which could hit economic growth and protein demand in the world's largest consumer of pork, as well as the coronavirus outbreak. LDC, also known as Dreyfus, is the \"D\" of the \"ABCD\" quartet of global agri-traders that also includes Archer Daniels Midland , Bunge and Cargill . Like its peers, LDC has restructured operations, exiting activities including dairy and metals trading while focusing more on food processing, notably in Asia. The company's top priority was to develop its business, said Louis-Dreyfus, a Russian-born Swiss citizen. \"Until 2018 we were in a process of consolidating the company's shareholder structure. Now the company is free of that issue and can fully focus on the business.\" A new investor should bring value to strengthen the company, she said. \"It is not only about size. It is also about quality.\" Speculation about consolidation has been rife in the industry since takeover approaches for US-based Bunge. Commodity group Glencore made an approach for Bunge two years ago and has said the sector needs consolidating. China's COFCO International has also been seen as a potential bidder for other trading firms as it expands overseas. In October 2019, Dreyfus reported a first-half net profit from continuing operations of US$73 million, down from US$91 million a year earlier, and said international trade tensions and the swine disease epidemic would weigh on its annual profit. Full-year 2019 results will be published later this year. Louis-Dreyfus said it would show a \"resilient\" bottom line despite a challenging backdrop of swine fever and trade tensions, which depressed US soybean imports into China. \"We are adapting to a new reality of higher volatility and political unpredictability,\" Louis-Dreyfus said, adding that a recovery of crush margins - the profits made from processing soybeans - and cost savings should help 2020 results. A cost-cutting programme announced internally in November is being led by new Chief Operating Officer Michael Gelchie, whose appointment was part of a recent management reshuffle, the latest in a series of changes. \"We are cautiously optimistic that we shall see a rebound in 2020,\" she said. Over the past decade, Louis-Dreyfus has bought the shares of minority family members wishing to sell under a long-term arrangement established by her late husband, Robert. Akira increased its ownership in LDHBV to over 96 per cent from 50.1 per cent. \"In fact, all we have been doing these years is following Robert's guidance to develop the company's strategy,\" she said.","summary":"LONDON: After 169 years of keeping the business in the family, agricultural commodity giant Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC) is open to selling a large non-controlling stake to an external stakeholder, its chairwoman told Reuters.

The International Basketball Federation announced the switch from Foshan on Tuesday due to health concerns over the fast-spreading virus that was first detected in the city of Wuhan and has now killed 170 people in China. No British team has previously qualified for an Olympic basketball tournament, other than as host nation. The women's team were fourth at last July's Eurobasket tournament, however, in Britain's best ever performance in the continent's showpiece event.

Yesterday was the first time in over 10 years working as a tour guide where there was barely any tourists,\" said Amie Hemthanon, a \"Love Andaman\" guide said on Thursday (Jan 30). \"Because China closed down a few of its cities, we took a big hit, the (Chinese) tourists are gone and 100 per cent cancellations going forward.\" More than 8,100 people have been infected globally in the outbreak, mostly in China, with millions of Chinese on lockdown as the authorities rush to stem its spread. Thailand itself has recorded 14 cases of coronavirus, all but one of them among Chinese people visiting Thailand. Amie's company usually operates 21 to 30 boats on the Andaman Sea in the peak season, ferrying tourists out to spots on the coast of Phang Nga province and the island of Phuket.

The latest Illinois case brought the tally of confirmed US coronavirus infections to six, none fatal, according to the Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC), as the number of Americans potentially exposed to the virus and placed under medical observation continued to rise. One of 195 US citizens evacuated from Wuhan, China, and voluntarily confined to a military base near Los Angeles for evaluation was slapped with a mandatory quarantine after trying to leave the facility, health officials there said on Thursday. The quarantine order, issued Wednesday night by the county health agency, requires the individual to remain at March Air Reserve Base for the full 14-day incubation period of the virus, rather than 72 hours as prescribed by the CDC to screen evacuees before they are released. None has shown any symptoms, a county health spokeswoman said. The quarantined person, whose identity was not disclosed, is complying with the order, she added. The first five known US patients are believed to have contracted the virus during visits to China, epicentre of the worldwide outbreak, whereas the newly diagnosed Illinois patient - confirmed by the CDC on Wednesday - was infected by his wife. \"This is the first case of person-to-person transmission in the US,\" said Dr Allison Arwady, a commissioner at the Chicago Department of Public Health. Even so, Arwady added, \"there is no local emergency\". The United States told its citizens Thursday night \"do not travel\" to China, raising its warning alert to the highest level because of the coronavirus epidemic. In issuing a level four travel advisory - up from urging Americans to \"reconsider\" travel to China - the State Department said it was acting after the World Health Organization declared the epidemic originating in the city of Wuhan an international emergency. In an updated travel advisory, the department said any Americans in China now \"should consider departing using commercial means.\". It recalled that last week it had ordered the departure of all non-emergency US personnel and their family members from Wuhan. \"The US government has limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in Hubei province,\" the advisory said. Concern about the new virus has mushroomed around the world as more cases turn up outside China. Health authorities still do not know how dangerous the virus is or how easily it spreads. The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the coronavirus outbreak in China a global emergency as cases spread to 18 countries. More than 200 deaths and nearly 10,000 cases have been reported in China, the vast majority in and around Wuhan, China, where it is believed to have originated in a market that traded in illegal wildlife. Airlines were facing mounting pressure by cabin crew to stop all flights due to unease about exposure to the rapidly spreading coronavirus, with American Airlines' pilots filing a lawsuit seeking an immediate halt. The Illinois Department of Public Health said it was tracking 21 people who had contact with the infected Illinois couple, both in their 60s. Officials said the husband had not recently taken public transportation or attended any large gatherings. He has been in isolation the past two days after showing symptoms and was immediately hospitalised, Arwady said. CDC experts said they were not surprised by the development and that further person-to-person cases were likely to emerge. \"We understand that this may be concerning, but based on what we know now, we still believe the immediate risk to the American public is low,\u201d CDC director Dr Robert Redfield said in a release on Thursday. Following the airlift of State Department employees and other Americans from Wuhan, Washington also was evacuating non-emergency government employees and family members from the US Embassy in Beijing and consulates in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang due to the coronavirus outbreak, a State Department official said on Thursday. The department also will charter additional evacuation flights from Wuhan, leaving on Monday or sooner, it said in a statement on its website.","summary":"WASHINGTON: The husband of an Illinois woman diagnosed with coronavirus after returning from a trip to China has also become infected, marking the first known person-to-person transmission of the disease within the United States, health authorities said on Thursday (Jan 30).

This comes a few months after Levi's opened its largest store in China in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic which has killed about 170 people, marring its plans to tap into the city's 11-million strong population. \"It will put a dampener on our growth objectives in the near term,\" Singh told Reuters in an interview about the store closures in China, which contributes about 3per cent to the company's revenue. The flu-like virus has set-off alarm bells across the globe, with companies such as Starbucks Corp  and Tesla Inc  warning of a financial hit from slowing business in the world's most populous country. Earlier this week, Starbucks also said it closed about half its stores in China. Levi's has also stopped all employee travel in and out of China. Singh said the coronavirus impact was not baked into the company's full year forecast, but will be quantified when it reports first quarter results in April.

Researchers did lab tests to see how long different amounts of gel and foam versions of alcohol-based hand sanitiser took to dry on nine volunteers' hands. In the test of 0.75ml, 1.5ml, 2.25ml and 3ml dollops, smaller amounts of sanitiser sometimes dried within the 20-30 second time frame recommended by the World Health Organisation for optimal effectiveness, but none of the products dried that fast when the largest amounts were used. \"Some people with larger hands may need a bit more product, and this paper demonstrates that the amount being dispensed in many standard dispensers is not providing the ideal amount of product,\" said Elaine Larson, professor emerita at the Columbia University School of Nursing in New York City. In the study, volunteers needed at least 2.25ml of sanitiser, and sometimes more, for optimal coverage on the front and back of hands. Gels dried faster than foams in general, with 3ml of gel taking 37 seconds to dry while the same amount of foam took an average of 57 seconds - both times exceeding the WHO recommendation. Researchers also looked at how much hand sanitiser health workers applied in real-world settings and compared how quickly workers thought it dried to actual drying times. Generally, workers thought sanitiser dried much faster than it really did. \"Staff have an unrealistic idea of the timing for hand hygiene,\" Larson, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. \"Alcohol is only active when it is wet so drying time is important.\" It's possible workers think drying times are shorter than they really are because they're using less product than they should be, aided in part by dispensers that release too little sanitiser in a single pump, the study team speculates. \"If a drying time is too short, sufficient effect cannot be exhibited,\" said Dr Ryohei Hirose, a researcher at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine in Japan who wasn't involved in the study. But health workers might think two pumps of sanitiser is more than they need, the researchers write in the American Journal of Infection Control. That means the amount dispensed might need to increase to ensure that a single pump releases the optimal amount of sanitiser, the study team concludes. \"A dispenser volume to achieve 20-30 seconds of drying time as per WHO recommendations is required for effective hand hygiene,\" Hirose, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. To fight germs effectively, alcohol-based hand sanitisers should contain at least 60 per cent alcohol, according to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. People should cover all surfaces of the hands, including spaces between fingers, and rub hands together for around 20 seconds, until hands feel dry, according to the CDC. When hands are dirty or greasy, people should ideally wash hands with soap and water, and only use sanitiser when handwashing isn't an option, the CDC advises.

Economists have said the repercussions on tourism could start showing as soon as next month and cautioned that if the outbreak is prolonged, it could chill travel demand worldwide and have a negative impact such as that seen during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Then, at the peak of the epidemic in April 2003, many countries in the Asia Pacific reported falls in tourist arrivals by more than 50 per cent as passenger demand in the region plunged 45 per cent, according to the International Air Transport Association. In Singapore, overall visitor arrivals fell by 15 per cent in March, followed by a steeper drop of 61 per cent in the first 13 days of April. As a result, average hotel occupancy rates fell sharply to between 20 per cent and 30 per cent, compared with normal levels of 70 per cent or above, official statistics showed. For now, about 20 per cent of inbound tour groups from other countries have requested postponements or cancellations, NATAS said. \u201cNATAS is deeply concerned of the current situation,\u201d its spokesperson said, adding that the association has sent out an advisory to all tour operators and guides as of Jan 29 \u201cto seek their cooperation in adhering to the guidelines to prevent any spread of virus\u201d. These include the daily cleaning of all coaches and rescheduling of itineraries to avoid over-crowded areas for tour operators, according to the guide seen by CNA. Tour guides are to don appropriate masks when on duty, practice good hygiene, look out for symptoms among tourists and arrange for immediate medical attention upon detection. EU Holidays said it has seen a \u201chandful of passengers\u201d holding back their holiday plans to the region so far. \u201cBusiness will definitely be affected,\u201d said the spokesman from EU Holidays. \u201cWe are cautious but confident with how (the outbreak) is handled by the Singapore Government.\" Dynasty Travel\u2019s Ms Seah also expressed hopes that the rapid containment measures adopted by governments around the world, as a result of the SARS experience, will mean \u201cshort-term pain for the long-term gain\u201d. To tide through the upcoming uncertainties, travel agencies said they have started reducing advertising spending on the Chinese market and are shifting their attention to other destinations instead. \u201cWe are negotiating deals with our travel partners to stimulate more travellers to other destinations,\u201d said EU Holidays. \u201cWe will have new measures to address the increasingly cautious sentiment.\u201d Meanwhile, NATAS declined to comment if its travel fair planned for Feb 21 to 23 at the Singapore Expo will go on as planned.

Ms Victoria Chong, marketing communications executive from Chan Brothers Travel, said \u201cnow might not be the most opportune time for such an event\u201d. EU Holidays said while it remains a participant of the travel fair for now, it will continue to monitor the situation and might pull out if it feels that the risk exposure for its staff and customers is too high. The new virus, which originated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed at least 170 and infected more than 7,700 people in China, the country's authorities said on Thursday.

What gets green, amber and red rankings","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/commentary\/wuhan-virus-how-prepared-your-company-work-flexible-continuity-12369936","article":"Levels of preparedness in the corporate world across Asia still vary widely from the best practices, to the minimally prepared, to the unprepared, says SafePro\u2019s Ross Darrell Feingold. SINGAPORE: Governments around Asia are racing to implement measures to stem the spread of the deadly Wuhan virus. Many have rolled out border health screenings, including Singapore and Malaysia, travel bans or require civil servants to work from home, like Hong Kong. In the corporate space, many companies and facilities management in Asia have already implemented hygiene measures such as entrance temperature checks, restaurant or co-working space location closures, increased availability of hand sanitisers, and, at the behest of governments, reviewed their business continuity plan. These high-stakes efforts cannot be understated, and require a wide range of actions, from assurances that frontline staff are safe to ensuring manufacturing operations can continue apace. Aeon, Japan\u2019s largest supermarket operator, expects sales to plummet by half, spokesperson Makoto Sueyoshi said on Monday (Jan 27). Apple has already provided a wider-than-usual forecast for this quarter\u2019s earnings given the uncertainty, as most iPhones are assembled in facilities in China. Managing a virus outbreak requires collaboration and coordination, as Senior Minister of State Dr Lam Pin Min said last December at an Infectious Disease conference. However, in our experience, levels of preparedness in the corporate world across Asia still vary widely from the best practices (which we grade with green), to the minimally prepared (an amber ranking), to the unprepared (or a red ranking). These provide a gauge for firms to benchmark how ready they are should the Wuhan virus situation escalate further. Best practices require the activation of business continuity committees or other mechanisms that include representatives across work streams. The most immediate best practice is to audit recent employee travel to identify employees who visited Wuhan or other parts of China, and require home isolation for the duration of the coronavirus\u2019s fourteen day incubation period. Many firms in Singapore are following this practice set by the Singapore Government. In Hong Kong, banks including Credit Suisse Group to Morgan Stanley have asked staff returning from China to work from home. Prudent employers will implement home isolation requirements region-wide, rather than only in locations with confirmed coronavirus cases. Employers, including UBS Group and Goldman Sachs, have also begun to ban all employee travel to China, though a concurrent measure should be to also ban visits by all China-based staff to locations outside China, especially with coronavirus deaths reported in Beijing, far from the epicentre in Wuhan. For both the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, and the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009, air travel was the cause of the introduction of this new virus into countries not primarily affected. Thus, careful employers are also gathering data for all recent employee data should an outbreak be traced to transportation hubs such as airports, or specific flights and trains. When it comes to insurance, well-prepared companies will review their business interruption coverage, supply chain, civil authority coverage (in the event of government ordered business closures), commercial general liability, environmental and employee travel insurance policies. Standard policies vary and may be subject to certain exclusions, while non-standard insurance policies are expensive. However, post-SARS and following other outbreaks in recent years, the corporate world was put on notice and companies with a culture of risk mitigation would have purchased insurance cover. Employers ahead of the curve are also liaising with healthcare providers, especially those connected to a company medical plan, to ensure that measures are in place to screen and deal appropriately with suspected Wuhan virus cases both at the company office and at the healthcare provider. Some general practitioners, like Banyan Clinic in Singapore, have isolation rooms stocked with necessary equipment to isolate ill employees until transport to a hospital can be arranged. Firms with regional offices should expect to see a wide range of illness patterns across locations, with strategies and responses to be adapted for each. Communications in local language discouraging employees from sharing rumours or other unverified information are thus also a critical best practice. Singapore authorities\u2019 move to stem misinformation through general correction orders may also be instructive for company leadership concerned about business continuity, reputation and accuracy of news. In China, firms from Foxconn to Didi Chuxing have issued masks, hand sanitisers or rolled out measures to disinfect corporate premises using internal staff or external service provides. US delivery giant FedEx is also distributing alcohol wipes to teams and teams. But these measures, while helpful, are half-measures if implemented with insufficient management oversight. Companies that have issued masks to employees in recent days should provide training on proper use so that employees do not have a false sense of security just because they put on a mask, and also ascertain that the masks are in working order. Similarly, hand sanitisers provided at the office are only effective if the product is property certified and staff are trained in proper use. For cleaning and disinfecting offices, Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Health and National Environment Agency have published up to date standards and best practices, including how much bleach or alcohol to use, and what precautions to take after the clean-up. If a service provider cannot meet these standards, companies should consider a change. When it comes to employee travel history, some companies are good at compiling data. However, without a tested contact tracing capability that can trace the precise movements of people, the data is of limited utility. The challenges in contact tracing guests who stayed at Hong Kong\u2019s Metropole Hotel at the onset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in February 2003, at which an infected medical doctor from Guangdong became the superspreader for the international spread of this dreaded virus, is a reminder how important contact tracing will be in the coming weeks. Organisations remiss in preparations, or, out of fear of offending foreign governments or customers from a country or territory with an outbreak, put employees and other stakeholders such as customers and vendors, at risk. For these reasons, even well-resourced organisations can be slow to respond to a crisis. Around the region, companies that regularly interact with large numbers of customers such as inter- or intra-city bus services, mass transit, hotels, cinemas, malls and the like can do better to train staff on proper hygiene measures or regularly disinfect the premises. Similar failures are an ongoing risk at companies with large numbers on-site employees such as at call centers or other campus-type settings. This increases the public relations and legal liability risks, especially when companies in the same industries have already set the standard for best practices. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) might lack the resources to implement risk mitigation measures such as temperature checks or to provide masks and hand sanitisers on-site. But flexible work and telecommuting arrangements, which government agencies are encouraging companies to implement, as well as employee travel bans, are within the means of SMEs. Guidelines from Singapore\u2019s Manpower Ministry updated this past week provide some instructive pointers on more precautionary measures. Regardless of company size, office cultures in Asia that encourage long working hours are common, but employers who do not monitor employees on-site presence and discourage excessive working hours increase the likelihood that run-down employees will be susceptible to illness. Similarly, if the office culture discourages sick workers from staying home, or there is a fear of reprisal for doing so, employee health can be jeopardised.

JOHOR BAHRU: Johor is the frontline of Malaysia\u2019s battle against the Wuhan virus. Out of eight confirmed cases of the coronavirus infection in the country, seven were detected in the southern state. The virus has prompted travel restrictions. China has grounded flights in and out of Wuhan and banned tour groups abroad. Meanwhile, Malaysia has temporarily suspended the granting of visas for Hubei province residents. The decision was made despite Malaysia and Johor being increasingly reliant on Chinese tourist dollars. While these are challenging times for Johor's tourism sector, the state government has prioritised public safety and stepped up precautionary measures. Johor\u2019s executive council member for tourism, Ms Liow Cai Tung, told CNA that the travel restrictions as a result of the spread of the virus will definitely affect the state\u2019s tourism sector. She noted that China has imposed travel restrictions from Wuhan and its surrounding cities since Jan 23. \"Hence, we believe that incoming tourists from that area will fall,\u201d said Ms Liow. She added that the \u201cunexpected situation\u201d surrounding the spread of the virus will impact the Visit Johor 2020 campaign in the short term. \u201cWe will streamline our tourism strategy once the virus has been contained. I hope people will stay calm and pray so that those infected by the virus will recover, regardless of their nationality,\u201d said Ms Liow. The foot traffic at major Johor Bahru shopping malls such as City Square, Komtar JBCC and Toppen Shopping Centre appeared to be less than usual this week. Ms Rabiah Rahmat, who owns a small store at Komtar JBCC selling traditional Indian snacks told CNA that business has dipped by more than 50 per cent. \u201cThere are barely any visitors since the first cases were announced in Johor,\u201d said the 42-year-old. Over at Legoland and Desaru Coast\u2019s Adventure Waterpark, only a handful of visitors could be seen. These attractions are popular among visitors from China. A tourism planning expert interviewed by CNA warned that the impact on tourism in Johor this time round may be worse than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) crisis in 2003 which crippled tourism in the region. Prof Amran Hamzah from University Teknologi Malaysia said: \u201cThe tourism industry is relatively resilient but this is a huge test not only for Johor but also globally.\u201d The restriction was lifted a week later but those from China and Vietnam were required to obtain medical certificates saying that they were SARS-free. As a result, the total number of tourists from all countries to Malaysia fell by 20.5 per cent in 2003 as compared to 2002. Furthermore, the country\u2019s tourism receipts dipped by 17.4 per cent within the same period. Prof Amran added that the current situation could impact Johor harder, as the southern state has become particularly reliant on Chinese tourist dollars, especially with targeted attractions like Forest City appealing to the Chinese market. \u201cThe (current situation) could even be worse than SARS given Malaysia\u2019s over-emphasis on the China market,\u201d he added. Despite the potential economic impact, the state government has ramped up measures to monitor entry points to safeguard public safety. Thermal scanners with monitors as well as digital thermometers have been placed at Johor\u2019s land border checkpoints Bangunan Sultan Iskandar near Woodlands Checkpoint and Kompleks Sultan Abu Bakar near Tuas Checkpoint to screen incoming visitors. When CNA visited the Bangunan Sultan Iskandar on Tuesday evening (Jan 28), several health officials wearing protective equipment and face masks could be seen monitoring a thermal scanner. The scanner was positioned to capture all incoming visitors as they headed to the immigration hall. In a speech on Wednesday during an annual safety conference, Chief Minister Sahruddin Jamal said that efforts undertaken have kept the situation \"under control\u201d. He said that measures to intensify health screening and monitor incoming visitors at all 12 entry points in the state have been \u201csatisfactory\u201d, especially at high volume areas at the land checkpoints and Senai International Airport. \u201cThe government agencies must instill confidence to the people through various mediums, including social media, to share their strategies \u2026 that aim to curb the spread of the virus,\u201d added Dr Sahruddin. The state government has also briefed hoteliers, tour guides as well as other industry players to ensure that they are prepared to combat the virus. Director for the Malaysian Association of Hotels (MAH) in Johor, Mr Ivan Teo, told CNA that hotels in the state have prepared faces masks and hand sanitisers in their premises. \u201cHotels under MAH have experience after learning from how to prevent the spread of the SARS virus in 2003, and hotel staff members have been trained on how to execute quarantine procedures,\u201d said Mr Teo. Meanwhile, the director for Malaysia\u2019s Budget Hotel Association in Johor, Mr Jarod Chia highlighted that all hotel staff have been briefed to ask their guests\u2019 travel history before they check in. Desaru Coast, an integrated eco-entertainment development in southeastern Johor, which includes resorts like Hard Rock Hotel and The Westin as well as the Adventure Waterpark, told CNA that it is adopting a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approach. However, it has also taken precautionary measures such as introducing screening across its premises and educating its employees on infection control and preventive steps. \u201cWe always follow the most up-to-date medical recommendations and continue to comply with the government\u2019s directive in executing our mitigation plan,\u201d the spokesperson said. Even drivers for tourist buses or vans have been advised to wear face masks and observe the health of their passengers. According to Mr Jimmy Leong, director for Johor\u2019s tourist drivers association, all drivers have been reminded to act quickly and report to authorities in case any of their passengers are unwell. In spite of the measures in place, tourism expert Prof Amran stressed that Johor\u2019s tourism policymakers should regard this as a reminder on the importance of developing domestic tourism, instead of relying on international visitors. \u201cThe lesson from SARS is that we should not neglect domestic tourism which managed to save the industry,\u201d said Prof Amran. He urged the state government to consider attractions and eco-tourism targeted at locals. \u201cOnce this global calamity subsides \u2026 we have to rethink our strategy and focus. We cannot go on with this obsession with numbers and should focus on quality,\u201d he said.","summary":"While these are challenging times for Johor's tourism sector, the state government has prioritised public safety and stepped up precautionary measures.

Within weeks, the virus has infected nearly 8,000 people in China and killed 170. Close to 100 cases have been confirmed in other countries, from Japan to the United States. On Thursday (Jan 30), the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a global emergency. Statistics from China indicate that just over two per cent of people known to be infected with the virus have died, suggesting that it may be less deadly than the coronaviruses behind Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). But disease experts caution that it will take several more weeks to be confident of how the new virus behaves given how quickly it has spread and the fact that a reliable diagnostic test has only recently been introduced. \"Not everybody is being seen, not everybody is being tested,\" Dr William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, told Reuters. \"All the experts, myself included, tell the public that there is much we don't know about this virus and we are learning as we go along. That is not so reassuring.\" Some experts question whether the new virus shares similarities with seasonal flu, which has a low mortality rate but infects so many people that more than half a million may die from it each year, according to global health estimates. The latest statistics indicate a fatality rate of about 2.2 per cent, but the actual rate may be higher or lower as there are likely more unconfirmed cases, he said. The SARS virus killed about 10 per cent of all infected individuals, while the MERS outbreak identified in 2012 had a fatality rate of around 35 per cent. In emerging infectious disease outbreaks, the most serious cases are identified first. Coronavirus infections can range from mild cold-like symptoms to severe cases that cause pneumonia, acute respiratory illness and death. About 20 per cent of confirmed cases in the China coronavirus outbreak are classified as severe, similar to SARS and MERS, Schaffner said. The previously unknown strain is believed to have originated late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan. Within weeks it appeared capable of being transmitted from one person to another via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings. \"The rapidity of this outbreak is startling and certainly much more rapid than SARS,\" said Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Britain's University of Nottingham. The incubation period is estimated between one and 14 days, and there have been anecdotal accounts of \"symptomless spreading\" by someone who is infected but unaware of it. Neil Ferguson, an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College London, says that is too early to know if so-called \"super-spreader\" events seen with MERS and SARS is happening with the new coronavirus. Some 60 million people are under virtual lockdown in China's Hubei province - of which Wuhan is the capital. Australia, South Korea, Singapore, New Zealand and Indonesia are quarantining evacuees from China for at least two weeks. Many global airlines have suspended or scaled back direct flights to China's major cities. Experts say China has been more forthcoming with information than it was during its 2003 SARS outbreak, but there are still concerns about how much data they are sharing. Some also questioned the effectiveness of the quarantine attempt on millions of people. \"That kind of thing can backfire. It can make it harder to get resources in,\" said Dr Amesh Adalja, from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.","summary":"LOS ANGELES: International alarm over the coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December is driven by its rapid spread and the fact that infectious disease experts cannot yet know how deadly or contagious it is.

REUTERS: Amazon.com Inc  on Thursday posted holiday quarter results well above expectations as the expansion of its one-day shipping program came under budget and membership in its Prime loyalty club notched a 50per cent rise in two years. Shares soared as much as 13per cent in after-hours trade, putting the online retailer back in the US$1 trillion (761 billion pounds) market capitalisation club. If the share gain holds on Friday, it will be the biggest daily jump for Amazon since October 2017. Amazon also forecast operating income of up to US$4.2 billion in the current quarter, down from US$4.4 billion the year prior. Still, that appeared to assuage investor concerns about Amazon's continued spending on fast delivery, which could have erased windfalls from e-commerce, advertising and cloud computing sales. \"We\u2019re past the worst in terms of the margin pressure from the one-day shipping initiative,\" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell. That and the \"massively overstated\" concerns about cloud competition rebutted some of the biggest arguments against buying the stock, he said. Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters that additional investment in one-day shipping came slightly under the US$1.5 billion the company had forecast for the fourth quarter, despite more customer orders. Extra costs in the current period will be about US$1 billion for the delivery effort, he said. Olsavsky added that spending on video would rise going forward, but the company was still determining its overall level of investment for 2020. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, said in a statement that the world's biggest online retailer now has more than 150 million paid members in its loyalty club Prime, a 50per cent increase from its last disclosure in April 2018. Subscribers keep returning to Amazon to benefit from perks like fast delivery, television and music streaming. Its suite of voice-controlled Echo speakers has prompted still more engagement from customers, and grocery orders more than doubled in the holiday quarter in a vote of confidence for Amazon's 2017 bet to buy Whole Foods Market. This formula has helped make Bezos the richest person in the world. Amazon is hoping that cutting delivery times to one day for Prime members will let it outmanoeuvre rivals such as Walmart Inc  that have marketed two-day shipping without subscription fees. The company made progress in the holiday season, reporting that it quadrupled one-day and same-day deliveries over the year-ago quarter. Revenue from subscription fees grew 32per cent to US$5.2 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, Amazon said, as more shoppers signed up for Prime than in any period prior. Net sales rose 21per cent to US$87.4 billion while net income rose 8per cent to US$3.3 billion - each over US$1 billion more than analysts had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The profit rise reflects the evolving nature of Amazon's business. The company has been moving away from low-margin retail toward a marketplace model where it takes lucrative fees for shipping and advertising the products of other merchants on its platform. This has helped weather massive spending at Amazon, a company that has long passed up short-term results in favour of bets that could reap it future profit. For instance, faster delivery has meant a surge in hiring and related costs. The company said its full-time and part-time headcount rose 23per cent to 798,000 in the quarter, as it expanded both fulfilment and corporate software roles. Expenses similarly grew as the company moved inventory closer to customers and built out its last-mile delivery network, which now handles the biggest share of Amazon-ordered packages in the United States. Amazon said worldwide shipping costs rose 43per cent to US$12.9 billion. Amazon Web Services (AWS) also has seen infrastructure and marketing costs rise. The unit responsible for selling data storage and computing power in the cloud lost out to Microsoft Corp  in a high-profile deal last quarter to sell technology to the U.S. Department of Defense, in what could have netted the company US$10 billion over a decade. Amazon is contesting the contract decision. Microsoft on Wednesday reported a 62per cent quarterly rise in sales for its Azure cloud computing service. Yet Amazon posted better results than feared, growing revenue 34per cent to US$9.95 billion, similar to its third-quarter increase. \"This is important because it ends six quarters of measurable decline in AWS growth, reassuring investors that the segment has signs of stability,\" Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, said in a research note. Amazon's international business also narrowed losses to US$617 million in the fourth quarter. The company has less exposure to China than Apple Inc  and other technology industry peers, which may help it weather economic uncertainty surrounding the outbreak of the coronavirus. Olsavsky said Amazon is watching the situation very carefully and is starting to put China travel restrictions on employees. The company considers China to be a far less strategic market than India, which CEO Bezos visited earlier this month partly to announce a new US$1 billion investment in the country.

SEOUL: South Korea's SK Hynix , a chip supplier to Apple Inc  and Huawei, on Friday warned of growing uncertainties, after posting its lowest quarterly profit in seven years, hit by a protracted industry downturn. The tech company said it would be cautious about investments despite improvements in demand, joining its bigger rival Samsung Electronics in offering a guarded outlook amid trade tensions between the United States and China and the new coronavirus outbreak in China. SK Hynix, the world's No. 2 memory chip maker after Samsung Electronics , said its operating profit slumped 95per cent to 236 billion won (154 million pounds) in the December quarter, far below a 433 billion won average forecast drawn from 19 analysts, according to Refinitiv data. That is the lowest quarterly operating profit since the fourth quarter of 2012, and well below 4.4 trillion won a year earlier. The company also swung to a net loss of 118 billion won from a net profit of 3.4 trillion won, reflecting a decline in investment valuations of Japanese peer Kioxia. \"While SK Hynix sees the recent improvement in demand flows positively, the company will carry out more prudent production and investment strategies, as complexities and uncertainties still remain much higher than in the past,\" it said in a statement. Memory chip makers have suffered a double-whammy with the U.S.-China trade war hitting demand from clients such as smartphone makers and data centres, exacerbating oversupply after capacity increases during a boom in 2017. Despite the industry slowdown, chip shares rallied last year, fuelled by hopes that memory chip prices are bottoming out as trade tensions eased and tentative signs sprouted that demand is recovering from data centres and smartphones.","summary":"South Korea's SK Hynix , a chip supplier to Apple Inc  and Huawei, said on Friday its fourth-quarter operating profit slumped 95per cent, missing analysts' estimates, as chip prices were hit by oversupply and a demand slowdown.

Supporting sentiment were surveys showing Chinese manufacturing activity held steady in January while services actually firmed, though this was likely before the virus took full hold. Indeed, reports some Chinese provinces were asking companies not to re-start until Feb. 10 suggested activity would take a hard knock this month. For now, sentiment got a timely boost when Amazon's sales blew past forecasts and sent its stock soaring 11per cent after hours, adding over US$100 billion in market worth. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.4per cent, but was still down 3.8per cent on the week so far. Its 2.3per cent dive on Thursday had been the sharpest one-day loss in six months. Japan's Nikkei bounced 1.8per cent, recouping half of its weekly loss. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 firmed 0.2per cent, having rebounded late Thursday to end up 0.5per cent. The World Health Organization on Thursday declared a global emergency as the virus spread to more countries. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said the greatest worry was the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems. Yet investors took heart from comments that the drastic steps Beijing was taking would \"reverse the tide\" and contain the outbreak. \"Some shorts covered after the director gave the WHO's stamp of approval to China's aggressive containment effort,\" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiCorp. \"For now, the market's risk lights have shifted from flickering on red to a steady shade of amber, which could bring more risk back into play.\" Wall Street quickly recouped its losses and ended higher in the wake of the WHO comments.

Still, the flow of news on the virus remained bleak with China's Hubei province reporting deaths from the disease had risen by 42 to 204 as of the end of Jan. 30. More airlines curtailed flights into and out of China and companies temporarily closed operations, while Italy became the latest country to confirm cases of the virus. JPMorgan shaved its forecast for global growth by 0.3per cent points for this quarter, but then expected the loss to be made up over the rest of the year. The drum beat of bad news kept safe-haven bonds well bid, with yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury notes down 8 basis points for the week so far and near four-month lows. The yield curve between three-month bills and 10-year notes had also inverted twice this week, a bearish economic signal. In currencies, the star performer was sterling which jumped after the Bank of England confounded market expectations by not cutting interest rates on Thursday. The pound was last at US$1.3100, a surprisingly steady performance given this is the day the UK officially leaves the European Union. The dollar took a slight knock overnight when data showed the U.S. economy grew at its slowest annual pace in three years in 2019 and personal consumption weakened sharply. It was a shade firmer on the yen at 109.07, while the euro was steady at US$1.1030. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was steady at 97.858. The dollar has fared much better against emerging market currencies as investors ran from risk. Spot gold was almost unchanged for the week at US$1,571.20 per ounce, having failed to get much of a safe-haven bid as a range of other commodities, from copper to iron ore, were hammered by worries about Chinese demand.

It is a precautionary measure,\" MOE said. \"Although (not legally binding), we strongly urge those on a leave of absence to be socially responsible and comply with it.\" The leave of absence provisions cover students, teachers, non-teaching staff such as administrators as well as other non-school staff, including canteen vendors, security guards, kindergarten and student care centre staff. As of Jan 30, 852 students and 115 staff were on leave of absence across schools, polytechnics and ITE. \"As per the health ministry\u2019s guidelines, students who have visited Hubei and are currently serving their leave of absence may be issued with quarantine orders if they are at a higher risk,\" MOE said. \"Otherwise, they will continue to serve their 14-day leave of absence.\" Students who have been placed on leave of absence will be supported by a home-based learning plan, said MOE. \"Teachers will assign work from the textbook and workbook to help the affected students keep up with their classmates,\" said MOE. \"Students will also have access to the Singapore Student Learning Space, an online platform with a range of curriculum-aligned resources to support their learning.\" The education ministry also updated its Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page on its website, explaining some of the measures it has, and has not, taken. One question addressed the provision of hand sanitisers in classrooms. MOE said that hand sanitisers are not necessary if hands are washed thoroughly and regularly with soap. \"Some individuals may also be sensitive to sanitisers. Toilets in our schools and institutes of higher learning are well stocked with liquid soap. We will also be stepping up the cleaning of toilets to ensure they are clean.\" It also explained why schools are continuing to hold assemblies, co-curricular activities and other events. \"There is yet to be evidence of community spread of the Wuhan virus in Singapore,\" the ministry said. \"With the precautions we are taking such as temperature taking and leave of absence, health experts have advised that schools can continue to have mass sessions like assembly.\" On the issue of delaying the opening of schools for seven or 14 days after the Chinese New Year holidays, like Hong Kong did, MOE said that such a measure was not necessary. \"We had considered this, took advice from medical experts, and concluded that it is not necessary to do so, because there is currently no evidence of community spread of the virus in Singapore,\" it said. \"Ours is a different situation compared to Hong Kong's. Hong Kong is closer to the epicentre of the Wuhan virus outbreak and is closely connected to mainland China. The number of students and staff returning from mainland China are likely to be many times ours.\" The ministry added: \"We assessed that the number of students and staff returning from China recently is manageable, and a 14-day leave of absence will be more targeted, while allowing schools to open and life carry on as normally as possible, which is an important aspect to safeguard in an emergency situation.\" On Thursday, Singapore announced three new confirmed cases of the Wuhan virus, bringing the total of infected patients in the country to 13. All cases to date are Chinese nationals. The World Health Organization on Thursday declared a global emergency over the virus, which has also spread to about 20 other countries.

The measures were due to come into effect from Feb 7, but will now be moved up to Feb 1, Shinzo Abe told parliament. \"With this measure, we will refuse infected individuals entry to Japan,\" Abe said. \"We will swiftly study ways to strengthen immigration control for cases where infection is suspected but not confirmed,\" he added. Japan now has 14 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, an epidemic that is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Two of those returned on the first chartered flight and had shown no symptoms. As worries grew in Japan over a further spread of the disease, the government said it would refuse entry to anyone infected and consider stricter screening for suspected cases, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. Suga also told a news conference that the government would consider paying for the chartered flights out of Wuhan, as opposition lawmakers criticised its policy of charging passengers 80,000 yen (US$730) each.\"We decided on these changes in view of the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration of a global emergency,\" Suga said.

The designation allows compulsory hospitalisation and the use of public funds for treatment, among other measures.The third flight out of Wuhan, which arrived on Friday morning, brings the total number of expatriated nationals to 565, Suga said. Unlike other countries, which are opting to isolate returning citizens for between 72 hours and two weeks, Japan has asked evacuees to \"self-quarantine\". Japanese officials say there is no legal basis for them to forcibly isolate people who have not tested positive for the virus - and that will not change with the implementation of the new rules from Saturday. There was also outrage after it emerged that two people on the first evacuation flight from Wuhan initially refused to be tested for the virus, and were allowed to return home after being advised to avoid public transport and monitor their health. The government has said it cannot force people to take the test, and on Thursday night health ministry officials said the two individuals had now changed their minds and would take the test. Of the 206 people who arrived on a first flight on Wednesday, 12 have been hospitalised, with all but two of the other passengers staying at a government-designated hotel in Chiba outside Tokyo. A second evacuation flight carrying 210 people arrived on Thursday, with 26 passengers hospitalised after checks on board and at a health facility after landing. The remaining passengers are staying at government-designated accommodation, and all the passengers on the second flight were tested for the new virus, officials said.","summary":"TOKYO: Japan said on Friday (Jan 31) that it would bring forward the date that the coronavirus will become a \"designated infectious disease\" to Saturday from Feb 7, as a third chartered flight carrying Japanese citizens arrived from Wuhan.

The outbreak of the coronavirus has sickened nearly 10,000 people in China with the death toll at more than 200, prompting the World Health Organization to declare an international emergency. And the rapid spread of the respiratory illness has prompted businesses and factories to shut down, and airlines around the world have canceled flights, prompting concerns about the hit to China's economy and beyond. \"It would be irresponsible to offer any speculations around what may happen,\" Georgieva said at a forum. She cited the experience of the SARS epidemic in 2002-2003, which slowed growth in the short term, but then the economy righted itself. However, that epidemic occurred at a time when the Chinese economy was booming. The current outbreak comes as authorities are managing a slowdown amid the battering from the trade conflict with the US. \"The immediate impact is obvious. We have travel, tourism, manufacturing in China, and a little bit beyond China in Asia being impacted,\" Georgieva said, adding that for this quarter, very likely there would be some negative impact. But beyond that \"we just observe and assess.\" The IMF on Jan 20 projected the global economy would grow by 3.3 per cent in 2020, above the 2.9 per cent level last year, due in part to an easing in US-China trade tensions. Earlier in the day, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters the fund is monitoring the situation \"very closely,\" and reading \"the economic indicators on a real-time basis.\" \"If global supply chains were systematically affected or global financial markets were significantly impacted by increasing uncertainty, then obviously the impact would be greater,\" Rice said, adding that the effects would be more severe if the ailment spreads to other parts of Asia from China. Georgieva said the outbreak highlights the \"unpredictability\" that has become the norm in the world. She stressed that \"preparedness, prevention, early action ... has to get into the bloodstream of policymakers, it is, whether it is pandemics or a climate shock or geopolitical tension.\"","summary":"WASHINGTON: It is still too soon to gauge the economic impact of the virus outbreak on China's economy, beyond the first three months of the year, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said Thursday (Jan 30).

CHICAGO: American Airlines Holdings Inc  and its mechanics union announced tentative joint collective bargaining agreements on Thursday covering five maintenance and fleet service groups after more than four years of often bitter negotiations. The agreements are worth US$4.2 billion and offer more than 30,000 employees industry-leading wages, benefits, work rules, job security and retirement income, the union, the TWU-IAM Association, said on its website. They are still subject to ratification by union members. American's chief executive, Doug Parker, said in a statement that the maintenance and fleet service employees \"deserve contracts that include meaningful improvements in pay, quality of life and job protections.\" \"The tentative agreements deliver on all of these \u2014 and more,\" Parker said. Parker has been under pressure to reach contract deals with the airline's pilots, flight attendants and mechanics. The talks with mechanics were acrimonious at times, with the airline filing a lawsuit against the union in May accusing it of staging illegal slowdowns after stalled contract negotiations before a federal mediator. The union denied the accusations in court, and the parties returned to federal mediation in September. One major sticking point had been a push by American to outsource future maintenance work, something the union said will be protected under the new agreements. With the mechanics' deal under way, American can now turn its full attention to negotiations with its pilots and flight attendants. Talks with those two groups began at the start of 2019. Hundreds of members of the Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents 15,000 American Airlines pilots, picketed at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport on Wednesday, expressing their frustration at the lack of a new contract. In an escalation of tension, the pilots union filed a lawsuit against American on Thursday, demanding that the airline stop flights to China as health officials declare a global emergency over the rapidly spreading coronavirus. American on Wednesday said it would suspend flights from Los Angeles to Beijing and Shanghai from Feb. 9 to March 27, but it is still flying to China from Dallas.","summary":"American Airlines Holdings Inc  and its mechanics union announced tentative joint collective bargaining agreements on Thursday covering five maintenance and fleet service groups after more than four years of often bitter negotiations.

The States Times Review also said that \"Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Transport Dr Lam Pin Min confirmed that Singapore had run out of face masks, and insinuated that Dr Lam Pin Min was blaming Singaporeans for 'insensible and irresponsible' use of surgical masks\", said the Factually article. \"Mr Tan also posted that Singapore had run out of masks since last Sunday, less than three days after the first confirmed case,\" it said. Factually cited examples of Dr Lam \"clearly pictured in a warehouse which showed part of the Government stockpile of surgical masks\" and Mr Chan saying the Singapore Armed Forces will be packing millions of surgical masks to be distributed to households. \"This clearly indicates that Singapore has not run out of face masks for Singaporeans,\" it said. A targeted correction direction was also issued to Facebook, which means it has to publish a correction notice to all users in Singapore \"who access the falsehood through its service\". \"This is so that users who see the falsehood on a platform also see the correction notice on that platform,\" said the POFMA Office.

Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google Search, Baidu and HardwareZone will no longer be exempted from general correction directions under POFMA, \"given the evolving situation with the Wuhan coronavirus\", the authorities said on Thursday. Several Internet intermediaries were temporarily exempted from having to comply with correction direction requirements when POFMA came into effect on October 2019.

The PMI's component indicators painted a mixed picture of the sector.New export orders slipped back into contraction after rising for the first time in over a year in December while production slowed from a multi-month high but remained in expansionary territory. Total new orders expanded at a slightly faster clip than the month before. Demand ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday was said to have contributed to December's expansion after a tough year for China as it underwent a bruising trade war with the United States. China's economic growth cooled to its weakest in nearly 30 years in 2019.But despite a partial trade deal signed in mid-January, the latest numbers come as China took a hit in recent weeks from the spread of the new virus. The sub-index for imports fell deeper into contraction.Factories also continued to shed jobs in January, although the pace of reduction slowed. China watchers typically advise caution in their analysis of economic data early in the year due to the effect of the week-long Chinese New Year holidays, which usually slows activity.Many firms scale back operations or close for long periods around the holidays, which began on Jan 24 this year. This year, China's government extended the Chinese New Year holidays to limit the spread of the virus. In contrast, activity in China's service sector quickened with the official non-manufacturing PMI rising to 54.1 from 53.5 in December. However, the outbreak has been seen hitting service sectors such as transportation, tourism, catering and entertainment as people avoid crowded areas. Chinese holidaymakers have been staying home in a highly unusual Chinese New Year this year as local authorities closed public attractions, cancelled major events and urged people to avoid large gatherings.Cinemas around China have closed as well during what is generally a prime time for blockbuster releases.Other countries have told their citizens to avoid travel to China, with several airlines trimming back their schedules. Manufacturers, too, are not taking any chances, with Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn keeping its Chinese factories closed until mid-February. Toyota, IKEA, Starbucks, Tesla, McDonald's and Volkswagen were among the corporate giants temporarily freezing production or closing large numbers of outlets in China. The holidays may mean there is little immediate impact on auto-manufacturers' production, but there is growing concern surrounding the virus' longer-term effects on the economy. \"Extended closures could ripple through supply chains across China and beyond,\" Capital Economics said in a note to clients this week. Analysts estimated its impact on China's economy could be bigger than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which also originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.One bright spot might be construction, Capital Economics said in a note, with the sub-index for the industry rising to 59.7 in January from 56.7, a sign local governments have been quick to begin new infrastructure projects this year. \"We expect a big plunge of both manufacturing and service PMIs in February and March due to the coronavirus outbreak,\" Ting Lu, chief china economist at Nomura, said. Beijing will try to provide liquidity and credit support to the economy, especially to businesses severely hit by the outbreak, he said. \"However, it seems unlikely that these measures would turn the economy around in Q1 and part of Q2, as the virus outbreak may further weaken domestic demand and thus render the upcoming policy easing less effective.\"","summary":"BEIJING: China's manufacturing activity slipped in January, official data showed on Friday (Jan 31), as the country grapples with a new virus that has claimed more than 200 lives.Official figures released on Friday showed that the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, an early gauge of factory activity, came in at 50.0, down slightly from 50.2 in the month before.A reading above 50 indicates the sector is expanding while below 50 shows a contraction.The findings come as China battles the spread of a new virus that has caused an unprecedented shutdown of transport and manufacturing in China, and locked down much of Hubei province - the epicentre of the outbreak.

The first of up to four flights planned to evacuate South Koreans from the epicentre of a virus outbreak in China landed at the Gimpo International Airport west of Seoul around 8am (2300 GMT) after an unexpected half-day delay because China only approved one flight. The government had said none of the evacuees had any symptoms before departure, but one person could not board the plane due to fever after a final check at Wuhan airport, while 18 were sent to hospitals immediately upon arrival, vice health minister Kim Gang-lip said. \"There were different screening standards between China and us, and we conducted another check aboard the plane and put those who were showing symptoms in separate space on the second floor of the plane,\" Kim told a briefing. \"The other 350 will be sent to temporary lodging facilities where medical staff will provide daily quarantine and medical assistance for 14 days under thorough control without going out or receiving guests.\" The evacuees will be isolated at two facilities in Asan and Jincheon, cities about 80km south of capital Seoul. The plan triggered a strong backlash among nearby residents, with some people throwing eggs and expletives on Thursday at senior officials who visited to try to defuse their anger. Several hundred police officers were on hand at the facilities in Asan and Jincheon. In Asan, there was no sign of a major rally on Friday morning, but one angry protestor ripped apart a banner put up by a local civic group to welcome the evacuees. Around 720 South Koreans have signed up for charter flights, but Seoul's foreign ministry said they might have to reduce the number of flights to one or two. South Korea also reported its seventh confirmed case of the coronavirus on Friday, a 28-year-old man who returned from Wuhan via the eastern Chinese port city of Qingdao last week. The outbreak has prompted North Korea to declare a state emergency, though it is unclear whether there are any confirmed cases in the isolated nation. The two Koreas opened a new hotline between Seoul and Pyongyang after they agreed to temporarily close their joint liaison office in the North's border city until virus concerns are eased, the South's Unification Ministry said on Friday. The North also informed the South via the hotline that it has decided to postpone plans to remove South Korean facilities at its Mount Kumgang resort next month to prevent a virus outbreak, the ministry said.","summary":"SEOUL: A charter flight carrying 368 South Koreans from Wuhan arrived home on Friday (Jan 31) as tensions simmered around quarantine centres where they will be isolated, a plan vehemently opposed by nearby residents. \"The other 350 will be sent to temporary lodging facilities where medical staff will provide daily quarantine and medical assistance for 14 days under thorough control without going out or receiving guests.\" The evacuees will be isolated at two facilities in Asan and Jincheon, cities about 80km south of capital Seoul.

SEOUL: South Korea's SK Hynix , the worlds' No.2 memory chip maker, warned a new virus outbreak in China could pose a threat to chip production and said it would sharply reduce annual investment after posting a steep fall in quarterly profit. The spread of coronavirus, which has killed over 200 people and infected nearly 10,000 worldwide, threatens to hit the global economy. Manufacturers have suspended production in China and airlines cancelled flights, disrupting supply chains. \"We are preparing a contingency plan,\" SK Hynix finance chief Cha Jin-sweok told an earnings call on Friday. \"The chip market is continuing its improvements recently... but uncertainties linger.\" The virus outbreak has caused no production disruptions at Hynix, which has a chip plant in Wuxi, east China, but manufacturing could be impacted should the situation prolonged, Cha said. Up until late last year, prospects for the global chip market were improving, aided by the easing of the U.S.-China trade war, the rollout of 5G mobile networks and higher spending by the data storage sector that helped reduce bloated chip stockpiles. That optimism fueled a chip share rally, with SK Hynix rising 15per cent over the past three months. Shares in Hynix gained 2.3per cent on Friday, beating the wider market's  0.2per cent rise. SK Hynix's conservative outlook echoes that of bigger rival Samsung Electronics , which offered a guarded forecast on Thursday after posting a 34per cent profit drop. \"The conservative comments from Samsung and Hynix indicate  chip supplies would not grow significantly, which should help improve the supply-demand balance,\" said Song Myung-sup, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities. SK Hynix cut capex by 25per cent last year to 12.7 trillion won and said it will further cut investment this year. It did not give a  detailed spending plan. \"When the market conditions improve, we could flexibly review investment plans, but we will take a cautious approach considering market uncertainties,\" Cha said. Hynix, which supplies chips to Apple Inc  and Huawei, said its December-quarter operating profit slumped 95per cent to 236 billion won (153.68 million pounds), far below a 433 billion won average forecast and marking the lowest profit in seven years. It also swung to a net loss of 118 billion won from a net profit of 3.4 trillion won, reflecting a decline in investment valuations of Japanese peer Kioxia.

Tensions increased after about 7,000 people were held on a cruise ship in an Italian port following the isolation of two Chinese passengers over fears they could be carrying the coronavirus, despite preliminary tests coming up negative. Italian newspapers have reported cases of bullying or discrimination against Chinese people following the outbreak of the disease, which has now killed 170 in China and has spread abroad, with at least 15 countries confirming infections. \"It's extremely unpleasant, absurd, and infuriating,\" Francesco Wu, a member of the Italian Business Association Confcommercio, often called on to speak for the 30,000-strong Chinese community in Milan, told La Stampa daily. Racist episodes reportedly included Chinese tourists being spat at in Venice, a family in Turin being accused of carrying the disease, and mothers in Milan using social media to call for Italian children to be kept away from Chinese classmates. \"It's totally unjustified and it hurts even more because it involves children. It's a mix of ignorance and latent racism,\" Wu said. Local health officials have sent the schools concerned a letter stating that \"there is no need to introduce measures restricting the presence of Chinese children within school communities,\" according to AGI. There were some 300,000 Chinese living in Italy at the end of 2018, according to the National Statistics Institute (Istat). Italy has not had any confirmed cases of the virus. Despite that, Milan mayor Giuseppe Sala said Chinese tourism - worth some 300 million euros (US$331,000) a month to the city between hotels, shopping and restaurants - was down 40 per cent compared to before the virus.

The State Department issued a level four warning - up from urging Americans to \"reconsider\" travel to China - and said any nationals in China now \"should consider departing using commercial means.\" Japan on Friday also raised its travel warning for China to a level two on Japan's four-point warning system, advising people to \"avoid travel that is not urgent or is not necessary\".

Showroom traffic is expected to be sparse when extended Chinese New Year holidays end as much of the population is steering clear of public spaces, while output is set to plunge in the short-term. That is particularly true of Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak, a major automotive industrial hub that accounts for nearly 9 per cent of China's vehicle production and home to factories for many carmakers including Dongfeng Motor Group and its partners Honda Motor, Renault SA and PSA. \"We expect (China) vehicle production to decline 3per cent for the full year, with production down 15per cent in the first quarter, including the extended new year shutdown,\" Joseph Massaro, CFO for auto technology supplier Aptiv, told an earnings conference call. But he said delayed production could be made up in the second quarter. \"We don't view this as a full year issue at the moment.\" Seeking to rein in the epidemic, which has killed more than 200 people with nearly 9,700 confirmed cases of infection in China, authorities have extended Chinese New Year holidays by three days to Feb 2 although many areas and companies are telling workers not to come back before Feb 10. Prior to the outbreak, forecasts for the world's largest auto market this year had ranged from mild sales growth to small declines after two painful years of contraction due to a slowing economy, the US-China trade war and the chaotic introduction of new emission rules. Cui Dongshu, secretary-general at the China Passenger Car Association, said his prediction for industry-wide sales growth of 1per cent this year now \"under some pressure\". The holiday extension has discouraged dealers from ordering new cars from manufacturers at the end of the month as is their usual practice, virtually guaranteeing a decline in wholesale auto sales figures for January. \"Although sales volumes in the first three weeks of January were okay, there was no 'sales sprint' at the end of the month. So it is inevitable that we will see a significant sales drop,\" Cui said in a blog post. The big unknown is, however, just how far the outbreak, which authorities have said they expect to peak in February, will ravage Chinese consumer spending. Industry officials and analysts agree car sales will be hit in the short-term but also say the impact might not be too bad over the whole year. The outbreak could even change the mindset of the Chinese consumer towards car ownership, given that many are suffering in areas where public transport has been suspended, said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight. \"It is hard to predict its impact in the longer term. Customers who do not have their own car might realise they need one which might help sales this year,\" he said. Automakers with plants in Hubei, particularly in its capital Wuhan, which has seen its transport links cut off as part of a lockdown to curb the virus, will have the most work to do in rejigging production plans. Production delays can often be made up later with extra shifts on weekends and at night. Honda, which has three assembly plants in Wuhan with Dongfeng, said it was assessing how transport disruptions were affecting the supply of parts and that no decision had been made on when its factories will restart. PSA's venture with Dongfeng said in a statement it will extend the Chinese New Year holidays for its workers but has not decided on a precise date. Renault plans to adjust its Wuhan production plans in line with guidance from local authorities, a company representative said. A Dongfeng representative said the company's decision on when to resume work will depend on the situation of the virus outbreak.","summary":"SHANGHAI: The new coronavirus epidemic is likely to wreak havoc on China auto sales and production in the first quarter, but it is too early to push panic buttons as ground could be made up later in the year, industry executives said.

Several of the 13 confirmed Wuhan coronavirus cases in Singapore are currently warded in isolation rooms at the centre. Mr Lee said the country was able to quickly catch cases of the virus, as well as isolate and treat them, adding that doctors have told him the patients are faring well. \"But we have to continue to be vigilant, because the outbreak is far from over. In fact, it may still be accelerating in China,\" said Mr Lee. \"We have to continue to be on guard,\" he said, adding the Government and healthcare workers were prepared. Continuing on this path would help ensure community spread of the virus is not a problem here, he said. \"There's every reason to be watchful, but there's also every reason to be confident,\" said Mr Lee. The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday declared the virus outbreak a \"global emergency\", with more than 9,800 confirmed cases and more than 200 deaths in China alone.

China has reported nearly 10,000 cases and 213 deaths, but the virus has spread to 18 countries, mostly, presumably, by airline passengers. The United States has advised its citizens not to travel to China, raising its warning to the same level as those for Iraq and Afghanistan. US airlines, which have been reducing flights to China this week, were reassessing flying plans as a result, according to people familiar with the matter. It is possible the White House could opt to take further action to bar flights to China in coming days, but officials stressed that no decision has been made. The Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents American Airlines pilots, cited \"serious, and in many ways still unknown, health threats posed by the coronavirus\" in a lawsuit filed in Texas, where the airline is based. American said it was taking precautions against the virus but had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. On Wednesday (Jan 29), it announced flight cancellations from Los Angeles to Beijing and Shanghai, but is continuing flights from Dallas. APA President Eric Ferguson urged pilots assigned to US-China flights to decline the assignment. In a statement, the American Airlines' flight attendants union said they supported the pilots' lawsuit and called on the company and the US government to \"err on the side of caution and halt all flights to and from China.\" Pilots at United Airlines, the largest US airline to China, concerned for their safety will be allowed to drop their trip without pay, according to a Wednesday memo from their union to members. United announced on Thursday another 332 US-China flight cancellations between February and Mar 28, though it will continue operating round trip flights from San Francisco to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. The American Airlines pilot lawsuit came as an increasing number of airlines stopped their flights to mainland China, including Air France KLM SA, British Airways, Germany's Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic. Other major carriers have kept flying to China, but protective masks and shorter layovers designed to reduce exposure have done little to reassure crews. A US flight attendant who recently landed from one major Chinese city said a big concern is catching the virus and spreading it to families, or getting quarantined while on a layover. \"I didn't understand the gravity of the situation until I went there,\" she said on condition of anonymity, describing general paranoia on the return flight, with every passenger wearing a mask. \"Now I feel like I'm on a 14-day countdown.\" Thai Airways is hosing its cabins with disinfectant spray between China flights and allowing crew to wear masks and gloves. Delta Air Lines is operating fewer flights and offering food deliveries so crew can stay in their hotels. The carrier is also allowing pilots to drop China trips without pay, a memo from its union to members said. Korean Air Lines and Singapore Airlines are sending additional crew to fly each plane straight back, avoiding overnight stays. The South Korean carrier also said it was loading protective suits for flight attendants who might need to take care of suspected coronavirus cases in the air. Airlines in Asia are seeing a big drop in bookings along with forced cancellations because of the coronavirus outbreak, the head of aircraft lessor Avolon Holdings Ltd said, adding the impact could last for some months. The outbreak poses the biggest epidemic threat to the airline industry since the 2003 SARS crisis, which led to a 45 per cent plunge in passenger demand in Asia at its peak in April of that year, analysts said. Fitch Ratings said airlines with more moderate exposure to China and the Asia-Pacific region were likely to be able to re-deploy capacity to alternative routes to mitigate the effect on traffic, but that could increase competition on those routes and reduce airfares. Air France, which maintained China flights throughout the SARS epidemic, suspended its Beijing and Shanghai flights on Thursday after cabin crews demanded an immediate halt. \"When the staff see that other airlines have stopped flying there, their reaction is 'Why are we still going?',\" said Flore Arrighi, president of UNAC, one of the airline's four main flight attendants' unions.","summary":"CHICAGO: Pilots and flight attendants are demanding airlines stop flights to China as health officials declare a global emergency over the rapidly spreading coronavirus, with American Airlines' pilots filing a lawsuit seeking an immediate halt. In a statement, the American Airlines' flight attendants union said they supported the pilots' lawsuit and called on the company and the US government to \"err on the side of caution and halt all flights to and from China.\" Pilots at United Airlines, the largest US airline to China, concerned for their safety will be allowed to drop their trip without pay, according to a Wednesday memo from their union to members. United announced on Thursday another 332 US-China flight cancellations between February and Mar 28, though it will continue operating round trip flights from San Francisco to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. The American Airlines pilot lawsuit came as an increasing number of airlines stopped their flights to mainland China, including Air France KLM SA, British Airways, Germany's Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic. Other major carriers have kept flying to China, but protective masks and shorter layovers designed to reduce exposure have done little to reassure crews. The carrier is also allowing pilots to drop China trips without pay, a memo from its union to members said.

Competition in the industry is expected to grow tougher this year as Sony prepares to launch its next-generation PlayStation 5 for the Christmas season, and with upcoming 5G mobile phones expected to offer more sophisticated gaming. But Furukawa said the Switch's life cycles and customer bases were different from rival consoles. \"Other companies' business moves will not have a special impact on our business,\" he said. The original Switch console, a hybrid that can be used for handheld play or hooked up to a screen at home, has become a huge global seller. It is entering its fourth year, which Furukawa described as the \"early stage of its middle life.\" But its sales are still solid with powerful software titles. Last September, Nintendo also launched a scaled back, cheaper version of the console, called Switch Lite, which is a strictly handheld device. Its sales have also been solid. In December the Kyoto-based firm behind Super Mario and Pokemon rolled out the flagship Switch model in China via Tencent to further boost its global reach. After the stock market closed on Thursday, the company reported a leap in sales and profit for the nine months to December, upgrading its full-year profit forecast on strong demand for Switch consoles. But the stock fell more than four percent on Friday. \"Its earnings were not bad but market expectations had been higher,\" said Makoto Sengoku, market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute. The absence of a console launch would not hurt Nintendo much thanks to its hit software titles, he added. \"The new coronavirus is rather worrying,\" he added, noting it could disrupt Nintendo's shipments from Chinese factories. \"Stocks related to inbound tourists have been falling but now investors have realised Nintendo could also be affected,\" he said.

A community in crisis but Wuhan residents fight back with calls for solidarity","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/commentary\/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-residents-jiayou-fight-back-situation-12372762","article":"Quarantined residents at the epicentre of the Wuhan coronavirus epidemic are rallying together even though they have had to be isolated to prevent a further spread of the deadly virus, says Yvonne Su. GUEPLH, Ontario: In Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, residents have been shouting \u201cWuhan jiayou\u201d meaning, \u201cWuhan, stay strong\u201d out of their windows, from apartment building to apartment building, to send words of encouragement to fellow citizens, doctors and medical staff at the front lines of the battle. When facing a crisis, humans historically seek solidarity. Community solidarity is often seen as a great way for the community to feel alive and charged with energy after facing hard times. This solidarity was seen after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 and after Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 2013. More recently, there are tales of neighbours shovelling each other out of their homes after the historic snowstorm in Canada. Near Manila, strangers offered up their homes to evacuees of the Taal volcano eruption. As the 11 million citizens in Wuhan entered the sixth day under lockdown because of the coronavirus, people have been forced to stay indoors to limit their contact with others. As fears grew, some felt the need to boost morale and create a sense of community solidarity. Soon, social media posts circulated asking residents in Wuhan to go to their windows and shout out \u201cjiayou\u201d starting at 8 pm local time. The posts were widely shared, leading to the phenomenon that took place. Jiayou directly translates to \u201cadd oil\u201d in a way that might mean \u201cadd gasoline to your car\u201d so you can continue to push hard and do what you need to do. In a general sense, the sentiment is \u201cstay strong\u201d or \u201ckeep going\u201d. Jiayou is a common phrase used to encourage someone if they are facing a challenge. As the city of Wuhan faces the life and death challenge of the coronavirus, jiayou works as a phrase that resonates with residents of a city struggling to survive. Wuhan jiayou is now the motto of Wuhan to keep spirits high in the face of this spreading pandemic. In addition to raising morale and giving a strong sign of life to a city that has been rendered a ghost town, the jiayou chants have also served another purpose: For the global media audience, it has helped to humanise the citizens of Wuhan. Even with the exceptional stories like the reporting of \u201cWuhan jiayou\u201d by the BBC and the Guardian, however, many media outlets still inevitably contribute to reducing the people at the core of these stories into numbers and statistics. So far, it seems, with a few exceptions, the global mainstream media has focused on medical and scientific stories. The images and videos shared of Wuhan are of a ravaged and scary ghost town. Some include videos of overflowing hospitals and medical staff in heavy protective gear. Others have spread stories of apocalyptic fear. Many social media posters have engaged in fear mongering. With all this, it can seem that few have treated the citizens of Wuhan as anything but potential carriers of the virus. While these videos and images depict the reality of a city dealing with a pandemic, the face masks and crowded hospitals allow viewers to overlook the silent majority \u2014 the tens of millions of people in self-isolation at home. The jiayou chant and the videos that captured it have since gone viral. It is a way for citizens to reclaim their narrative. It also draws attention to the millions of diligent and law-abiding citizens who are doing their job in fighting this pandemic and encouraging others to keeping going in this fight against an invisible virus. I believe the humanisation of Wuhan citizens can help send a wake-up call to the world about the plight of those not infected but isolated in their homes. Many countries are focusing on whether the virus will spread to local communities. Few may have stopped to think of those in lock down in Wuhan and other cities in China. Most recently, in Wuhan, Premier Li Keqiang\u2019s visited a Wuhan supermarket where the coronavirus allegedly originated. In an act of solidarity, he chanted \u201cJiayou Wuhan\u201d with a crowd of shoppers to encourage them to continue fighting the coronavirus. But in this act also lies signs of how such acts of solidarity can be co-opted by government bodies. This type of co-opting was observed in the exaggerated use of \u201cresilience\u201d and \u201csurvival\u201d narratives after Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines to paint a picture of a rapidly recovering community doing well by being resourceful and helping each other. These narratives of community resilience pushed forth by official government messages can act to shift attention away from the state and international humanitarian organisations that have formal responsibilities in disaster risk reduction and recovery. Thus, Premier Li Keqiang was able to use the peoples\u2019 chant, \u201cWuhan jiayou\u201d to rally support in the grocery store. But he did not create a space for questions about accountability and government action. This is often the double-edged sword of community solidarity: It is powerful, but it can also be appropriated by the powerful.

In a statement on Friday (Jan 31), Primary Industries Minister Teresa Kok said Malaysia is in full solidarity with the people of Wuhan. \u201cAt present, hospitals in Wuhan, the Central Chinese city, at the crux of the coronavirus outbreak, are calling out for much needed protective medical supplies such as masks, suits and gloves, as supplies run low. \u201cThe medical gloves, both natural rubber and nitrile, will be sent to China in batches with the first shipment being already on its way to Wuhan,\u201d she said. Ms Kok said that her ministry had obtained the cooperation of the Malaysian Rubber Export Promotion Council (MREPC) and rubber gloves manufacturers in Malaysia on the initiative. It was during the Chinese New Year period but the companies stepped forward and gave their commitment in ensuring this initiative would be a success, she said. \"Malaysian glove industry players are prepared to be at the forefront of supplying high-quality medical gloves to the world, especially in critical times such as this to battle against the outbreak and the current pandemic,\" she said. Two companies, Top Glove and Supermax have already donated 2.3 million pieces of gloves through their local offices and distributors to Wuhan, she said. Malaysia is the world's leading producer of medical gloves, with approximately 180 billion pieces exported worldwide annually. In 2014, Malaysia sent more than 20 million medical rubber gloves to five African nations (Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria and Congo) which were battling the deadly Ebola virus. China has been Malaysia's largest trading partner for 10 consecutive years, with trade growing 8.1 per cent to RM313.8 billion (US$76.7 billion) in 2018. On Friday, the World Health Organisation declared the 2019-nCov outbreak a global health emergency. As a measure to contain the virus, the Chinese government earlier announced a lockdown of 16 different cities, including Wuhan. The virus has claimed over 200 lives in China. Nearly 10,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide. Malaysia currently has eight confirmed cases, all of which involve Chinese nationals. Malaysia has said it will initiate a negotiation as soon as possible with the Chinese government to bring home 82 citizens in Wuhan. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad said: \u201cRight now, they (Malaysian citizens) are not allowed to leave Wuhan, but we want to negotiate with the Chinese government so that the Malaysian citizens who are not sick can (be allowed to) return to Malaysia\". He said if China allows them to return, they will be subject to 14 days of quarantine to make sure that they are not suffering from infection. Additionally, Dr Mahathir said Putrajaya will bring in supplies to help the Chinese government when sending charter flights to bring Malaysians home. \u201cWe are interested to help Wuhan, so if we have to send a charter flight to evacuate our citizens from Wuhan, if allowed by the Chinese government, we will also bring food, gloves and face masks because they are facing supply shortage over there,\u201d he said.","summary":"KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian government will be sending 18 million pieces of medical gloves to healthcare workers in Wuhan amid an escalating coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThe medical gloves, both natural rubber and nitrile, will be sent to China in batches with the first shipment being already on its way to Wuhan,\u201d she said. \"Malaysian glove industry players are prepared to be at the forefront of supplying high-quality medical gloves to the world, especially in critical times such as this to battle against the outbreak and the current pandemic,\" she said.

The United States, Japan and Singapore are among nations that have already sent aircraft to remove their nationals. China has sealed off the city, effectively quarantining more than 50 million people in Hubei province, including thousands of foreigners. Here are five questions on the evacuation efforts answered. Authorities will have to \"really, really clean the airports and prevent transmission at every step of the logistics - it's a huge risk\", said Wang Linfa, director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says the risk of contracting a disease on board a plane is in general similar to other confined, crowded spaces such as buses or trains. \"That said, the risk on airplanes is probably lower than in many confined spaces because modern planes have cabin air filtration systems equipped with HEPA filters,\" it adds. Singapore airline Scoot, which flew home 92 people on Thursday, provided surgical masks to all passengers and required its crew to wear N95 masks and surgical gloves. To limit physical interaction, food packs were left on seats before take-off and no meals or drinks were distributed in-flight. Scoot said temperature screening was conducted at check-in and again before boarding, and those with a fever were prevented from flying. Air India enforced similar measures in New Delhi's evacuation effort on Friday. \"There are risks but on the other hand, the risks of leaving them at the epicentre of the global outbreak are significantly higher with the strain on resources there,\" said Dr Paul Tambyah, an infectious diseases expert at the National University of Singapore. International aviation agencies have protocols for evacuations that include having empty seats between passengers and ensuring good air quality and flow, he added. Thousands of non-Chinese citizens remain trapped in Wuhan watching helplessly as others are flown home on government-chartered flights. Many left in the city have described an atmosphere of fear and confusion as well as uncertainty about food supply. Wuhan is a virtual ghost town, with restaurants and shops shuttered. \"It's unfortunate but citizens of countries that don't have that kind of diplomatic wherewithal are going to have to deal with the situation that they're presented with,\" said China analyst Drew Thompson, a former US Department of Defense official. \"They're going to have to hunker down ... and stay in contact with their embassies, and make do, just like their Chinese friends and counterparts.\" Singapore authorities said some Singaporeans were unable to return because they had symptoms of the disease. It was \"not safe\" for them to be on the same plane as the 92 Singaporeans who returned, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong. The Singapore embassy is in touch with all of them to ensure their welfare, he added. Quarantine arrangements for evacuees vary from country to country. Japan's policy of \"self-quarantine\" has sparked fierce criticism. Two of Wednesday's returnees initially refused to be tested for the virus although officials said the pair were later willing to be checked. \"It's a difficult scenario,\" said Wang. \"You just do your best to ... educate the citizens, to say, \"'we'll help you to help us'\". \"In most circumstances self-quarantine is more than enough if the citizen is educated.\" In South Korea 18 passengers on an evacuation flight were immediately sent to hospital on arriving back in their country Friday after displaying symptoms of the coronavirus. The 92 Singaporeans who returned had to undergo medical screening at Changi Airport. Those with fever or respiratory symptoms were taken to hospitals for further examination. The returning Singaporeans who do not have symptoms of the virus, as well as the consular officers who accompanied them, will be quarantined for 14 days. French and British returnees will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while Americans will be voluntarily isolated for three days at a US airbase. The virus's incubation period, during which patients are infected but show no symptoms, is between two and 17 days, meaning a two-week quarantine should catch about 99 per cent of cases, said Wang. \"It's all about risk assessment,\" he said. \"There's no such thing as a single quarantine (type) for all citizens in all countries coming from any part of the world.\"","summary":"BEIJING: Countries are scrambling to airlift their citizens from the Chinese city of Wuhan as it struggles to get to grips with the spread of a SARS-like virus which has claimed more than 200 lives nationwide.

The round-the-clock packing operation at the SAFTI Military Institute started on Thursday (Jan 30) evening after the multi-ministerial task force announced that each Singapore household will receive a pack of four masks. The SAF will use large vans and operational utility vehicles to deliver the masks to 89 Residents' Committee centres and Community Centres, after which the People's Association (PA) will distribute them to the public. The SAF personnel are working eight-hour shifts, with each shift expected to pack 200,000 masks. They will aim to deliver the first batch of masks on Friday evening and finish the operation by Saturday evening. Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said the SAF is \u201cvery aware\u201d that all agencies in Singapore have to \u201clean forward\u201d to do its part in tackling the Wuhan coronavirus. \u201cEvery new biological outbreak can be very serious if we are not quick enough to take up the right measures,\u201d he told reporters at the packing area on Friday. This comes as Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Thursday that there is a sufficient supply of masks in Singapore if managed properly, amid concerns over a lack of availability at retailers islandwide. Many people in Singapore are donning surgical masks as a form of protection against the coronavirus, although experts have cautioned it could create a \"false sense of security\" if not used properly. On Friday, 450 servicemen wearing gloves, masks and hair nets sat at rows of tables in a large hall \u2013 chosen for its sterile environment and proximity to a transport line. Servicemen who leave the hall have to sanitise their hands before returning to the tables. They removed masks from a small box and placed four of them in a Ziploc bag. These then go into a larger carton that can contain 400 of such bags. Each van can carry up to 14,000 bags. Other servicemen help to pack the large cartons and move them to vehicles waiting outside. After this 8am shift ends at 4pm, another will take over. The SAF personnel include non-uniformed staff as well as full-time national servicemen and regulars from the Combat Service Support Command. Dr Ng said the servicemen took a few hours after being activated to prepare the entire set-up, including getting materials like masks, ziploc bags and packing boxes from various agencies. Nevertheless, he said the servicemen were \u201con track\u201d with their progress, adding that they were in good spirits. \u201cYou know that when you do this, you\u2019re doing it to protect your family and fellow Singaporeans, and you\u2019re very proud of it,\u201d he stated. It is not the first time the SAF is conducting such an operation \u2013 during the haze crisis in 2013, it packed and distributed more than 1 million masks to the public through the PA. The SAF is also helping out in other areas of the battle against the Wuhan coronavirus. Dr Ng said that as part of contact tracing, SAF personnel are making a hundred calls a day to people in Singapore who have travelled to Hubei province recently to ask about their condition. They are also manning thermal imagery equipment at airports and will inform airport staff if they detect symptomatic passengers. The minister stressed that these SAF personnel are not in direct contact with passengers, adding that they were not trained to do so. Dr Ng had also said in a Facebook post on Thursday that the SAF is using its premises for quarantine cases. On Friday, he said the SAF is \u201ccareful\u201d to ensure it maintains operational readiness even as it deploys resources to contain the Wuhan coronavirus. \u201cEven though it\u2019s a national effort, we want to make sure that the SAF keeps its eye on its primary responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not compromise security, even though this is important, and that is why we mobilised the Combat Service Support Command, whereas other operational units are still on tasking.\u201d When asked if there are SAF servicemen currently in China, Dr Ng said the SAF has instructed personnel to defer non-essential travel to the country, adding that there were also no upcoming bilateral exercises with China. \"Even if (the trip to China is) important, they have to get clearance,\" he added.

China has advised its citizens to postpone trips abroad and cancelled overseas group tours, while several countries including Germany and Britain have urged their citizens to avoid travel to China. The United States told its citizens Thursday night \"do not travel\" to China, raising its advisory status to the highest level of alert.

China has taken extreme steps to stop the spread of the virus, including effectively quarantining more than 50 million people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province.

These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore, as part of restrictions that will come into effect at 11.59pm on Saturday. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will, with immediate effect, suspend the issuance of all forms of new visas to those with Chinese passports. Singapore's status as a visa-free transit facility will be suspended for Chinese passport holders. Previously issued short-term and multiple-visit visas for those with Chinese passports will also be suspended. Those who hold such visas will not be allowed into Singapore during this period. In a press release on Friday evening, the Manpower Ministry also announced that with immediate effect, it will reject all new work pass applications for foreign workers from mainland China until further notice. Renewal applications for existing work pass holders will not be affected. Earlier this week, the restrictions only applied to new visitors who had recently travelled to China's Hubei province. However, China recently announced that the number of reported infections in the country had doubled since Jan 28 to more than 9,000 and that the likelihood of widespread community transmission in other parts of China is now high. \"As a result, we are likely to see a sharper rise in the local transmission of the virus in Chinese cities beyond the Hubei province in the coming days,\" said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a press release on Friday. At the briefing, Mr Wong also said that Singapore residents with recent travel history to mainland China will be issued a travel advisory and asked to take a 14-day leave of absence. These include Singapore citizens, PRs as well as those with long-term passes. Commissioner of ICA Marvin Sim, who was at the briefing, said the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore will be disseminating the information to all airlines to ensure smooth implementation of the new measures. Cabin crew who have to travel to China as part of their job will not be subject to the new measures, but in consultation with the Health Ministry, will have to take precautionary measures, he said. They will only be able to enter or transit if they are well, he added. \u201cThese additional travel restrictions on top of all that we have already introduced over the past few days will enable us to limit the number of new cases here and to reduce the risk of community spread in Singapore,\u201d said Mr Wong, who co-chairs a ministerial task force set up to deal with the coronavirus situation. Responding to a question from the media, Mr Wong stressed that the restrictions are not nationality-based. \"It is not a nationality issue,\" he said. \"The motivation is the origins of the virus and that beyond Hubei, the virus is now spreading to other parts of China - as we have said, there is assessment that this is happening.\" \"This is the policy because it is difficult to know your previous travel history.\" At the operational level, there may be appeals,\" he added. The passport is being used as a \"proxy\", he said. \"I can imagine somebody may say 'I\u2019m a passport holder, but I have not be in China all this while'. I think we can take that separate from the policy, and at the operational level, ICA will have to deal with these instances,\" he said. Meanwhile, MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak said there remains no evidence of community spread. Of those suspected of having the coronavirus, 164 of them have been ruled out while test results are still pending for 49 others. \u201cThe situation remains fluid, it is constantly changing.

He arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 26, and reported to be asymptomatic on his flight but developed symptoms on Jan 28. He sought medical treatment at a clinic on Thursday and was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) in an ambulance. The man tested positive for the coronavirus at about 11pm on Thursday. He is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. Prior to admission, the man stayed at home in Jurong East Street 13. The 15th case is a 47-year-old Singaporean, who had travelled to Wuhan with her family and was one of the 92 Singaporeans who were evacuated from the city on Thursday. She was asymptomatic when she boarded the flight, but was found to have a fever during the medical screening at Changi Airport and was taken to NCID.

He tested positive for the coronavirus at about 2pm on Friday and is currently warded in an isolation room at the Singapore General Hospital. All three cases are in stable condition, said MOH. The death toll in China has risen to 213, with nearly 10,000 infected, according to official figures released on Friday. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the situation a global emergency. All of the 13 previously confirmed cases in Singapore came from Wuhan in Hubei province. The first case of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore was confirmed on Jan 23 - about a month after the first cases were reported in the Chinese city. The seven men and six women, aged between 31 and 73, are being treated at isolation wards at NCID, Changi General Hospital, Singapore General Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital. In its press release on Friday, MOH shared more information about the 13th confirmed case, a 73-year-old woman who arrived in Singapore on Jan 21. The ministry said she was a close contact of the second confirmed case and multiple attempts were made to contact her. She was located on Jan 28 and reported having developed symptoms on the same day. The woman was taken to NCID, where she was isolated, and she tested positive for the coronavirus at about 2pm on Thursday. MOH said that prior to her admission, the woman stayed at ParkRoyal Collection Pickering and Oasia Hotel Downtown, and visited Changi Airport and Jewel. She travelled by taxi and private transport. None of the 13 previously confirmed cases are critically ill, said the ministry. \"All of them remain in stable condition and most are improving,\" it added. As of noon on Friday, 198 of the suspected cases have tested negative for the virus. Test results for the remaining 35 cases are pending. MOH also said that it has identified 202 close contacts as of noon on Friday. Of the 162 who are still in Singapore, 156 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining six close contacts, said MOH. Singapore on Friday announced that it will widen travel restrictions to include all new visitors with recent travel history to China. China also said it will send charter planes to bring home citizens from Hubei who are overseas \"as soon as possible\". The announcement came as a number of airlines, including Singapore Airlines and Scoot, announced they were halting or reducing flights to China as the country tackles the spread of the virus. In a bid to contain the possible spread of the virus, a total of 967 students and employees from schools in Singapore have been placed on leave of absence because of their recent travel history to China. On Saturday, authorities will begin distributing packs of four surgical masks for each Singapore household. There have been long queues for masks at pharmacies and retailers across the country. Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Thursday reassured people that Singapore will have enough masks, provided the supply is managed \"appropriately\". Retailers were also warned against profiteering. A letter of demand was sent to retailer Deen Express after complaints of masks being sold at high prices at its store. The retailer will have to explain to the Price Controller the \u201cbasis of their selling prices for the sale of masks, including their cost price and profit margins\u201d. Mr Chan discouraged people from panic buying and hoarding masks, saying it could \"jeopardise the entire system\". Medical experts CNA spoke to cautioned that masks may offer a \"false sense of security\" if they are used wrongly by people protecting themselves against viruses. They should be used by people who do not feel well and are coughing, so as to protect others, a WHO representative said.","summary":"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) confirmed three new cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore on Friday (Jan 31), bringing the total to 16 cases.

He praised the efforts of Singaporeans who have been buying food and running errands for their neighbours who are under quarantine. \u201cThese are heart-warming efforts, and it speaks loudly of the big heart and resilient spirit of Singaporeans,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the spirit that we need and we want to stand together to defeat the virus and the challenge it poses. We have done it before, as with SARS, and we can do it again.\u201d There remains no community spread of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore as of Friday evening. Three new cases were confirmed by MOH, one of whom was a Singaporean who was evacuated from Wuhan earlier in the week. The 13 previously confirmed cases are in stable condition and making \"good clinical progress\", said Mr Mak. None of them are critically ill, he added. Fifteen of the total confirmed cases are Chinese nationals who had travelled to the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. \u201cTo date, there\u2019s no evidence of any local spread to any Singapore resident in Singapore and we remain watchful and vigilant to make sure that this continues to be so. Contact tracing for contacts of our local cases continues, and it is still underway,\" he said. Asked about the possibility of cancelling events such as the Singapore Air Show over virus fears, Mr Wong said scheduled events will proceed as planned but precautions will be taken. Some attendees may be prevented from showing up due to the travel restrictions, but there are no plans to cancel the Air Show at this stage, he added.","summary":"SINGAPORE: Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran said on Friday (Jan 31) that the Government has heard \"troubling or disturbing stories\" of landlords who are evicting people serving their home quarantine or taking leave of absence, as Singapore ramps up on precautionary measures against the spread of the coronavirus here. \"This is not the kind of response we need,\" said Mr Iswaran in a press conference, which was also attended by Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority commissioner Marvin Sim.

Two Bills will be introduced during the sitting for the first time, The Hindu Endowments (Amendment) Bill and the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill. Six will be tabled for a second reading, including the Singapore Convention on Mediation Bill and the Active Mobility (Amendment) Bill, which seeks to extend the e-scooter ban on footpaths to all motorised personal mobility devices (PMDs). MPs have submitted more than 50 questions on a range of issues, with several MPs such as Desmond Choo, Rahayu Mahzam and Liang Eng Hwa asking about the Government\u2019s measures to deal with the Wuhan coronavirus should the outbreak worsen in Singapore. The virus, which originated in China\u2019s central Hubei province, has killed more than 200 people and infected nearly 10,000, mostly in China. The Ministry of Health on Friday announced confirmed 16 cases in Singapore, including one Singaporean, as authorities widened travel restrictions to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Singapore\u2019s medical preparedness is also in the spotlight after the Lucky Plaza car accident, where the victims were taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital instead of the nearby Mount Elizabeth Hospital, which was not equipped to handle severe trauma patients. MP Joan Pereira is asking if the Government will consider requiring all private and public hospitals to be equipped and manned to handle severe and multiple trauma cases in their accident and emergency departments as part of Singapore\u2019s emergency preparedness plan. Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) Daniel Goh will ask whether the emergency departments of private hospitals should be upgraded for a tiered national accident and emergency system. As Australia declares a state of emergency over the bushfires threatening large parts of the country, climate and other environmental issues are some of the issues that will be discussed. MP Seah Kian Peng will ask if the Australian bushfires have threatened Singapore's environment and food security. NCMP Dennis Tan will ask if the Government has any plans on reducing greenhouse emissions from Singapore's oil refining industry, while MP Louis Ng will ask if the Government could publish its collection of the 2019 carbon tax payments. On other issues, NCMP Leon Perera will ask about the reasons for the discoloured tap water in the Basic Military Training Camp (BMTC) on Pulau Tekong last year and what measures are being taken to reduce the risk of such an incident in future. He will also ask what the Government is doing to address attitudes of students and educators towards the sexual objectification and harassment of women, in light of concerns over voyeurism cases at institutes of higher learning. MP Cheng Li Hui will suggest that the Government conduct a review of the funeral industry in Singapore, after a mix-up resulted in the wrong body being cremated. MP Christopher de Souza will also ask about the rise in piracy and robbery cases in the Singapore Strait and its surrounding waters.","summary":"SINGAPORE: The Wuhan coronavirus and Singapore's medical emergency preparedness are among the issues to be discussed when Parliament sits on Monday (Feb 3).

In an alert on its website, SingCERT said that such criminals would send emails and messages enticing users to open malicious attachments by offering information relating to the outbreak of the deadly virus. The World Health Organization had said earlier on Friday that the outbreak is now an international emergency, following China's announcement that the death toll had topped 200. SingCERT said the malicious files could be masked under the guise of links, PDF, MP4 or Docx files with link or file names associated with the coronavirus situation, such as how to protect yourself from the virus, updates on the threat or virus detection procedures. These files could host a range of threats from Trojans to worms, which are capable of destroying, blocking, modifying or copying data, as well as interfering with the operation of computers or computer networks, when users click on the links or open the attachments. \"In particular, there have been reports of an active Emotet malspam campaign in Japan where cyber criminals sent emails that were disguised as official notifications from disability welfare service providers and public health centres. \"These emails claimed to provide details on the preventive measures against the virus, in order to entice potential victims to open the malicious attachments in the emails,\" said SingCERT. \"Due to the heightened concern about the situation, it is likely that there will be more of such threat actors who will ride on the situation to conduct their malicious cyber activities,\" it added. Global cybersecurity company Kaspersky also warned of the threat of cyber activities riding on coronavirus fears. In a press release on Friday, Kaspersky malware analyst Anton Ivanov said: \u201cThe coronavirus, which is being widely discussed as a major news story, has already been used as bait by cybercriminals. \"So far we have seen only 10 unique files, but as this sort of activity often happens with popular media topics then we expect that this tendency may grow.

The novel coronavirus first emerged in early December in the Chinese industrial city of Wuhan and has since spread to dozens other countries. China's economy traditionally has a voracious appetite for raw materials. \"The reality is that shocks to the Chinese economy always have ripple effects and the commodity markets are deeply affected by it,\" said AvaTrade analyst Naeem Aslam. \"In simple terms, when economic engines start to grind, the demand for fuel falls.\" As the virus has spread, the oil price has slumped in both London and New York, collapsing by more than 20 percent since a January 8 spike which had been triggered by tensions between Iran and the United States. This week, the main benchmark contracts - New York's West Texas Intermediate and London's Brent North Sea oil - plunged to three-month lows as virus-linked demand fears intensified. On Friday, they first stabilised somewhat after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency, sparking hopes of better international coordination to combat the disease, before resuming their downward trajectory. The price falls have however raised eyebrows at the OPEC oil exporters' cartel, whose 13 member nations pump 40 percent of global crude and are anxious to safeguard revenues. \"The dramatic price slump in recent days appears to be making OPEC nervous,\" added Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch. As Beijing battles the outbreak, it has been forced to take drastic measures that have slowed the world's second largest economy. China's oil imports were slashed by almost two million barrels per day in the period January 15-22, compared with the average daily level for January 2019, data shows from Paris-based energy sector intelligence firm Kpler. And since the start of the year, the superpower's oil imports are down by about three million barrels per day, according to Kpler. OANDA analyst Craig Erlam said the overall market impact would hinge on how long the epidemic lasts. \"The longer it takes authorities to get a grip of the coronavirus and the more it spreads, the greater the potential economic impact and the impact on oil consumption.

Some nervous customers have begun to ask waiting staff if they are Chinese, according to Corlier, whose Vietnamese father-in-law runs the kitchen and serves up traditional dishes like pho soup. Others are simply staying away. \"There's a sort of unfounded psychosis setting in around the Asian community and Asian food,\" the restaurateur said, adding that his revenues were down 40per cent for the first few weeks of 2020 compared to the same period a year ago. The virus outbreak that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan has infected more than 9,800 people - mostly in China but with some 130 cases in 24 countries and regions outside mainland China, including six cases in France. It has killed 213 people in China and sparked a wave of travel curbs and other efforts to stop the spread, both inside China and abroad. As well as Chinese nationals, France's big Asian community includes many people of Cambodian and Laotian descent, and one of the largest contingents of Vietnamese overseas - a legacy of France's former colonial presence in south-east Asia. Asians in France this week created a Twitter hashtag #Jenesuispasunvirus (\"I am not a virus\") to signal abuse. Racist incidents, slights and slurs have been reported from the school playground to supermarkets, according to Laetitia Chhiv, who runs an association for young people of Chinese descent. \"We had a student of Chinese origin in Strasbourg who was shouted at by a woman who told him not to touch the avocados she wanted to buy,\" Chhiv said. \"That was after she asked him where he was from and whether he had the virus.\" Worries over the virus are reverberating across Paris in other ways too, with high-end stores that rely on Chinese tour groups hurting as the flow of visitors dries up. At some retailers, staff said French customers were also staying away, partly out of fear of mingling with Asian clients. \"Racism against Asians is spreading even faster than the virus,\" said Sun-Lay Tan, who works in the art world and is French-born of Chinese and Cambodian descent. \"I was sitting on the metro on my way to work and the person next to me edged a few centimetres away and put his scarf over his mouth.

Atotech, which makes specialty chemicals and equipment for printed circuit boards and semiconductors, had planned to kick off its IPO process this week by publishing an indicated price range. However, Carlyle became concerned that Atotech's production and business exposure in China, as well as the broader market volatility caused by the outbreak, would hurt investor demand in the IPO, the sources said. Atotech operates several manufacturing facilities in China, accounting for 38per cent of the revenue in its chemistry segment, which in turn makes up about 90per cent of its business, according to its IPO registration. It could not be learned when Atotech was planning to resume its IPO preparations. If the delay extends beyond Feb. 14, the company would have to resubmit its IPO filing to U.S. regulators to include full-year earnings, pushing back the process further. The sources requested anonymity because the decision is confidential. Atotech and Carlyle declined to comment on the IPO plans and on any potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak on Atotech's business in China. To be sure, the window to go public is still open for companies with less or no exposure to China. Household goods maker Reynolds Consumer Products  and digital-focused healthcare provider 1Life Healthcare Inc , which is also backed by Carlyle, successfully completed IPOs this week. Carlyle acquired Atotech in 2016 in a deal worth US$3.2 billion, including debt.

Stephane Bancel is chief executive of Moderna Therapeutics, one of several entities involved in an all-out international effort to create a vaccine as soon as possible for the deadly SARS-like virus, also known as nCoV-2019, that has already killed more than 200 people. Moderna is working in coordination with the US National Institutes of Health, while Inovio Pharmaceuticals and the University of Queensland in Australia are pursuing alternative tracks. They have all received funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), an international body established to finance costly biotechnology research. But Bancel warned that \"no manufacturer will be able to have a vaccine ready for the summer\". In a French-language interview with AFP, Bancel also described the technology Moderna was using in its approach. \"It is based on messenger RNA technology. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a coded information molecule,\" he said. Moderna's website explains that \"mRNA medicines are sets of instructions that cells in the body use to make proteins to prevent or fight disease.\" Bancel added that \"once we have managed to master the technology that works on humans, things could go very quickly because it is always the same manufacturing process ... for messenger RNA against the flu or against the coronavirus, it is the same method of manufacturing, the only difference is the order of letters that code the proteins. \"For the coronavirus, we are working with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). They acquired the virus' sequence from the Chinese government, then the NIH and our teams analysed it to understand the protein structures, which are different from other viruses. \"Our teams near Boston are making a vaccine now, and as soon as it is ready, it will be sent to the NIH which will carry out clinical phase 1 trials\" Bancel said in reference to initial safety tests on humans. Asked if a vaccine could be developed in time to respond to the epidemic, he cautioned that \"the vaccine will have to undergo several clinical trials. \"The challenge is that it could quickly be given to millions of people. The responsibility for its safety is therefore very important. Even going quickly with technolgy like mRNA, no manufacturer will be able to have a vaccine ready by the summer, or even by the autumn.\" Bancel emphasised that \"the only answer now is public health actions, trying to contain human to human transmission as much as possible. \"I think the biggest public health challenge will be during winter in the southern hemispere, along with the risk that it comes back to the northern hemisphere in the fall,\" he forecast. \"It is very had to predict today if the situation will be serious in the fall or if the virus will have disappeared. \"But one advantage of getting a coronavirus vaccine approved, is that if there is a mutation to another virus later, it will be possible to have a product available quickly.\" In a separate interview with the European Pharmaceutical Review, CEPI chief executive Richard Hatchett said: \"Our aspiration with these technologies is to bring a new pathogen from gene sequence to clinical testing in 16 weeks - which is significantly shorter than where we are now.\" Brancel told AFP there were risks for his company to take on this kind of project, but that CEPI funding removed a major obstacle. \"There is a risk that the product does not work, because biotechnology is complicated. There is also a risk that another solution is found before we do and that it becomes the blockbuster product that everyone prescribes. \"That is why partnerships with CEPI are very important. CEPI provides us with the funds to make the first batch of vaccines for the NIH. That removes a big thorn from our side. \"The idea behind CEPI is to obtain regulatory approval for a dozen vaccines, for viruses like Zika or coronavirus, because they pose a great threat to humans. \"We need approved vaccines so that if there are mutations within a strain of virus, we can produce vaccines in large quantities within a few months.\"","summary":"PARIS: No manufacturer will have a coronavirus vaccine ready for use before the middle of 2020, despite an intensive global effort, a biotech executive told AFP on Friday (Jan 31).

Even going quickly with technolgy like mRNA, no manufacturer will be able to have a vaccine ready by the summer, or even by the autumn.\" Bancel emphasised that \"the only answer now is public health actions, trying to contain human to human transmission as much as possible. \"But one advantage of getting a coronavirus vaccine approved, is that if there is a mutation to another virus later, it will be possible to have a product available quickly.\" In a separate interview with the European Pharmaceutical Review, CEPI chief executive Richard Hatchett said: \"Our aspiration with these technologies is to bring a new pathogen from gene sequence to clinical testing in 16 weeks - which is significantly shorter than where we are now.\" Brancel told AFP there were risks for his company to take on this kind of project, but that CEPI funding removed a major obstacle. \"The idea behind CEPI is to obtain regulatory approval for a dozen vaccines, for viruses like Zika or coronavirus, because they pose a great threat to humans.","datetime":1580534580000,"date_time":1580682718000},{"title":"Nearly 200 Americans airlifted from China placed under coronavirus quarantine","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/world\/americans-airlifted-china-placed-quarantine-12376426","article":"WASHINGTON: Nearly 200 Americans evacuated from China and voluntarily confined to a California air base for 72 hours of coronavirus screenings were placed under a mandatory 14-day quarantine on Friday (Jan 31), as US health officials intensified precautions against spread of the disease. The move by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), its first quarantine in 50 years, was announced a day after the State Department issued its strongest warning against travel to China due to an epidemic of the new virus, which has claimed more than 200 lives. \"We are preparing as if this is the next pandemic, but we are hoping that is not the case,\" said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center For Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a telephone interview from the agency's headquarters in Atlanta. The United States angered China on Friday after it issued a travel warning over a coronavirus epidemic that has been declared a global emergency and led to increasing supply problems for businesses. Originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the flu-like coronavirus first identified earlier this month has resulted in the deaths of 213 people in China, out of a total number of cases approaching 10,000. The quarantine order requires all 195 Americans airlifted from Wuhan to remain isolated in special housing at March Air Reserve Base near Los Angeles for the entire 14-day incubation period of the disease. The two-week period runs from the time they left China on Tuesday. \"This is a precautionary and preventive step to maximize the containment of the virus in the interest of the health of the American public,\" the CDC said in a statement. The CDC said on Wednesday, the day the evacuees landed, that they were being kept, on a voluntary basis, at the base for at least 72 hours while they underwent medical evaluation for symptoms of the virus and CDC laboratory tests. The plan then was to allow the passengers to return to their homes, absent any indication of exposure or illness, leaving state and local health authorities to continue monitoring the evacuees through the remainder of the incubation period. That plan would have permitted members of the group to take public transportation home. CDC officials said on Wednesday that people incubating the infection before symptoms appear are generally not regarded as contagious. But Messonnier on Friday cited emerging evidence that the virus can be spread by someone who is infected but not yet showing signs of being ill, which include fever, cough and other respiratory symptoms. The CDC also pointed to a limitation of the screening test it had developed for the virus. Even if a test result comes back negative, \"it does not conclusively mean an individual is at no risk of developing the disease over the likely 14-day incubation period,\" the agency said in a statement. \u201cWe are looking in people\u2019s noses to see if they have the virus there,\u201d but CDC is not certain the test is specific enough to identify whether someone is incubating the virus, Messonnier said. \u201cThis test is a point-in-time test that should not be relied on to predict whether this person will become ill.\u201d The blanket 14-day CDC quarantine for all 195 evacuees was instituted after one of the passengers, who was not identified, sought to leave the base without permission on Wednesday night. He was immediately slapped with an individual quarantine order issued by Riverside County health authorities. It was not clear whether that incident played a role in the CDC's quarantine order on Friday. As of Thursday, none of the group at the base had exhibited signs of the disease, local health officials said. The evacuees, who were flown aboard a government-chartered cargo jet to California after a refueling stop in Alaska, consist of State Department employees from the US Consulate in Wuhan, their immediate family members and some other Americans who were welcomed to join the flight, the CDC said. The State Department said Friday it is working with US and Chinese agencies to arrange for additional flights of Americans out of Wuhan. Washington also plans to evacuate non-essential government employees and family members from the US Embassy in Beijing and consulates in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang due to the coronavirus outbreak, a State Department official said on Thursday. The CDC has tallied six confirmed US cases of coronavirus, none fatal, including the first known transmission of the virus from one person to another within the United States - a couple in Illinois.","summary":"WASHINGTON: Nearly 200 Americans evacuated from China and voluntarily confined to a California air base for 72 hours of coronavirus screenings were placed under a mandatory 14-day quarantine on Friday (Jan 31), as US health officials intensified precautions against spread of the disease.

Sweeping new restrictions will also be imposed on American citizens, with those returning from the province at the disease's epicentre placed in facilities for mandatory 14-day quarantines, said Health Secretary Alex Azar. US citizens coming from other parts of China will undergo health screening at ports of entry and then be placed under monitored self-quarantine at home. \"I have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States,\" said Azar during a briefing at the White House, adding the directives would take effect on Feb 2 from 5pm eastern time (2200 GMT). \"Foreign nationals, other than immediate family of US citizens and permanent residents, who have travelled in China within the last 14 days will be denied entry into the United States for this time,\" he added. The restrictions apply to people who have travelled to the designated areas in the two weeks prior to their attempted entry. There have been six confirmed US cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, which originated in a live seafood market in Wuhan, in Hubei province, in December. The World Health Organization has already declared the epidemic a global emergency, and the Chinese death toll rose Friday to 213 while total infections reached nearly 10,000, surpassing the SARS epidemic of two decades ago. Three US airlines, American, Delta and United said they would soon suspend all flights to China. Earlier, officials imposed mandatory 14-day quarantine orders on 195 Americans who were air evacuated from Wuhan, the first time a federal directive of this kind was issued for more than 50 years. The last case involved a person who was evaluated for smallpox in the 1960s. A plane carrying the repatriated citizens, who include diplomats and their families, touched down at the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California, on Wednesday and officials initially said the passengers would be asked to voluntarily isolate themselves for up to 72 hours. Early signs were good, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared that none of the individuals showed symptoms of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. One of the individuals tried to leave the base and was placed under quarantine by the state of California, said CDC official Marty Citron, before the federal action. The repatriated group submitted samples for testing at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta - but officials now say they are not certain about the accuracy of their diagnostic tools. \"We are seeing in the cases that are in the hospital, we've seen people who had detectable virus, and they didn't have the technical virus, and then three days later they had detectable virus,\" said Robert Redfield, the CDC's director. Given that the extent of asymptomatic transmission was not yet clear, a negative test was not being used as a release criteria. \"It isn't like it's a horrible test, but it is not a test that's absolute,\" added CDC immunologist Anthony Fauci. Despite the seemingly drastic actions, the US public \"should not let fear or panic guide your actions,\" said senior CDC official Nancy Messonnier, but instead exercise normal precautions for stopping the spread of respiratory viruses. These include washing your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds, disinfecting surfaces, staying home when sick and covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and then throwing it in the trash. \"We do not currently recommend the use of facemasks for the general American public,\" said Messonnier. \"This virus is not spreading in your communities.\" \"Please do not assume that just because someone is of Asian descent that they have this new coronavirus,\" she added, noting there are four million Chinese Americans in the US.","summary":"WASHINGTON: The US said Friday it was declaring a public health emergency and temporarily banning the entry of foreign nationals who had travelled to China over the past two weeks to contain the spread of a deadly new virus.

The rest of the passengers were taken to a seaside holiday camp, near Marseille in southern France, where they will be kept in quarantine for two weeks. Announcing the flight on Wednesday, Buzyn had said that it would be reserved for people \"who show no symptoms\" of the virus that has killed over 200 people and infected nearly 10,000 in mainland China, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency. Buzyn said that \"if people have symptoms or are sick ... they will be repatriated on specific medical flights.\" On Thursday, the authorities confirmed a sixth case of the new coronavirus in France, a doctor who was infected by a person who had travelled from China. The person later returned to China and was confirmed to be sick with the virus. Three AFP journalists were onboard the 12-hour flight to France, which landed shortly after noon. The evacuees, most of them French or the Chinese spouses of French nationals, were given surgical face masks to wear throughout the flight, which they changed regularly after disinfecting their hands. The returnees included around 50 children, including some babies. All the passengers had their temperatures taken before boarding, and when they did they were still not sure of their destination, said AFP's Sebastien Ricci. The passengers, who were accompanied by a medical team, broke into applause as they touched down in France. They were taken to a holiday centre at Carry-le-Rouet, on France's southern coast, where medical supervision was available and the Red Cross was ready to bring in pre-cooked meals. \"For some, it is a real crossroads in life,\" said Ricci. \"They left Wuhan and don't know if they will go back there ... it's both a relief and a sad thing.\" That sentiment was shared by fellow traveller Adrien, 26, who has been working in the automobile industry in China. \"One hand there's sadness at leaving a country we had become attached to, but there's also relief because we didn't know how things would turn out (in Wuhan).\" Nicolas, a 30-year-old engineer who had lived in Wuhan for four years was nearing the end of his contract. \"It's fine. we had been in the dark for the past few days and we're just happy that a decision (to evacuate) has been taken.\" Buzyn said she would have liked to shake hands with the returnees but circumstances prohibited that.

SEOUL: In the South Korean city of Asan this week, residents held angry protests decrying their government\u2019s decision to quarantine South Koreans evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the growing outbreak of a new coronavirus, at a facility in their community. Among the many placards at the protest -- hung between pieces of heavy construction equipment to block the road to the facilities -- was one that read \u201cAsan citizens first.\u201d Protest signs are meant to convey simple, snappy messages and don\u2019t have room for much context. But it was clear from this slogan that the people of Asan felt that their government should put them first, that they shouldn\u2019t have to forego any of their interests, or risk their own health, to accommodate fellow citizens fleeing the hub of a public health crisis. In explaining their opposition, locals have said that the government picked Asan, and another city called Jincheon, as the quarantine sites without consulting them first. They have also pointed out that the quarantine facilities are in densely populated areas, where many children live. Social scientists have dubbed this way of thinking NIMBYism, with NIMBY being the acronym for \u201cnot in my backyard,\u201d a phenomenon whereby people in a certain location resist some change to the place that they live on no grounds other than that the proposed change, while being necessary or at least beneficial in a general sense for the wider society, isn\u2019t good for their specific community or locality. Pretty much everyone can agree that a country must have garbage dumps and sewage treatment facilities, yet no one wants those facilities near where they live because of the adverse effects on property values and quality of life. The locals in Asan were not arguing that their fellow South Koreans should be banned from returning to their country or that the national government had no responsibility to help get them out of Wuhan. They simply, for entirely selfish reasons, want them sent elsewhere. Curiously absent from this display of fiery dissent in Asan was any suggestion of what to do with the roughly 700 returnees. No South Korean city was likely to raise its hand and volunteer to host hundreds of people who could have been exposed to the deadly, poorly understood virus at this stage of the outbreak, when the number of cases is rising daily and no one knows how bad the outbreak could get. One might have expected that at this stage, cities would be willing to step forward and contribute to the state\u2019s handling of the public health crisis, to shoulder risk and burden as a way of working toward a solution. This case contrasts sharply with a heart-warming story of South Korean cooperation and sacrifice not too long ago. In 1998, as the country was reeling from the Asian Financial Crisis and the national government was billions of dollars in debt, citizens lined up to donate gold to help the nation climb out of debt. That story was upheld as demonstration of a deep social bond, of citizens willing to, at a time of economic disaster, give up personal assets to help out the country. Would anything like that happen today? South Koreans have long lamented that that same crisis in the late 1990s changed their country forever, introducing neoliberal economics, eroding the country\u2019s previous model of jobs for life and family-like companies. The crisis paved the way for a more competitive, individualistic South Korea where nothing is guaranteed and average citizens, like those who protested in Asan this week, see their society\u2019s elites as corrupt and out of touch. South Korea is a democracy, and democracies require a peculiar balancing of individual rights and collective goals. Citizens have a role to play in picking their leaders and agitating for policy decisions, but there are limits on what they can achieve. At some point, all citizens are asked to grit their teeth and accept things they may not like. In democracies, anyone who fulfils a duty to their state that requires they risk their own life -- career soldiers, police officers, emergency workers -- does so with their own consent. The preamble to South Korea\u2019s constitution states, the provision of \u201cequal opportunities to every person and provide for the fullest development of individual capabilities\u201d as a goal. Unfortunately there is a contradiction in that, as at some point, particular individuals must sacrifice for collective well-being. As the first chartered flight carrying 368 Koreans from Wuhan landed at the Gimpo International Airport on Friday (Jan 31) morning amidst continued anger among some residents in Asan and Jincheon, I couldn\u2019t help but ponder about how this could messy situation could have been averted or resolved. A potentially effective solution during a dispute like this is a show of leadership, for someone in a position of responsibility to set an example for the concerned citizens of Asan by showing that they are willing to take on some of the burden. Or for someone to show by example \u2013 which in this case would have been one of the cities putting up its hands to say they would welcome their evacuated fellow citizens to be quarantined in their neighbourhood. On the other hand, the government has acted more decisively than the last time an epidemic hit the nation \u2013 the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015 \u2013 by putting into quarantine and issuing medical assistance to infected persons early while also announcing that it will be drawing from an emergency fund to contain the virus as it aims to calm residents and investors. But it can still do better. Specifically, in this case of quarantining the evacuated Koreans, it ought to clearly communicate that the authorities are working actively to contain the corona virus outbreak, and has learned lessons about the need for strict quarantine from the MERS experience, when the government garnered criticism for failing to quarantine people who had been exposed to the virus. For now, the protests appear to have simmered down as the residents of Asan reportedly came to a decision to back down after an hour-long meeting on Friday. But with more than 300 Koreans left to be evacuated from Wuhan, the unrest may yet get new life in the coming days. This makes the communication from government an ongoing effort to ease citizens\u2019 worries. Political leadership handbooks also point to the importance of empathy, of leaders demonstrating that they care how their citizens feel. Asan citizens might feel more at ease if President Moon Jae-in came to their community to walk the city streets and listen to people\u2019s concerns. At the very least, that would allow Moon\u2019s government to send the key message: We\u2019re all in this together.

SINGAPORE: The coronavirus originating from China\u2019s Wuhan city is spreading quickly in the country as well as across borders since it was first declared on the last day of 2019. Since then, the deadly pathogen has killed more than 200 people and infected nearly 10,000 in China alone. It has also reached more than 20 places across the world, with Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand among the highest counts of confirmed cases. In Singapore, there have been 16 confirmed cases so far, all imported. CNA asked readers to submit questions on the coronavirus outbreak and had an overwhelming response. Questions ranged from how the virus is spread and whether it will affect pregnant women and their children. To answer these, we enlisted the help of medical experts such as those from the Duke-NUS Medical School - Professor Gregory Gray, Assistant Professor Danielle Anderson and Professor Wang Linfa, who was also part of the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) emergency committee looking into the virus outbreak -  as well as Professor Benjamin Neuman, chair of Biological Sciences from Texas A&M University. Prof Gray: They are very similar. Clinically, it is difficult to distinguish between the two; one really needs to use laboratory-based tests in order to do so. Prof Wang: Not much. Asst Prof Anderson: The symptoms of the flu and the Wuhan coronavirus are very similar and include fever, coughing and a runny nose. Prof Gray: Yes. The vast majority will fully recover after their illness. Prof Wang: Yes, and the majority do. Asst Prof Anderson: Yes, people can recover naturally following infection and the majority of patients (98 per cent) do indeed recover. But while it is possible to recover from infection, some patients can develop severe disease and pneumonia. Prof Wang: It is not known yet. Prof Gray: Unknown, but pregnant women are often at increased risk of respiratory infections. Asst Prof Anderson: Currently there is not enough information available to determine if there is maternal transmission to the unborn child.A pregnant woman may develop more severe disease as they are immunocompromised and are more susceptible to complications of respiratory infections. Prof Gray: Avoid having them come in contact with the public, especially people with respiratory signs and symptoms. Prof Gray: We don\u2019t know, but other respiratory viruses can, such as adenovirus which is a hardier type of virus. Prof Wang: Transmission through the swimming pool is unlikely unless the person is swimming very close to an infected person. Yes, it is possible to be infected through the eyes. Asst Prof Anderson: It is unlikely that the coronavirus can be spread through water, especially chlorinated swimming pools. Coronaviruses are also not known to be spread though the eyes.There is an anecdotal case of infection through the eye and, if this infection did occur, it is an extremely rare event. Prof Wang: It is mostly just normal hospital care for severe cases. I have been told all confirmed cases (of the Wuhan coronavirus) are doing well in Singapore. There are drugs being tried in China, but it is too early to scientifically gauge their success rate. Asst Prof Anderson: If a patient has respiratory symptoms they may require breathing support. In milder cases, they can be given an intravenous drip to maintain blood pressure. Fluids can also be given in cases of diarrhoea, and ibuprofen or Panadol can be used for pain relief. Prof Gray: There is no specific treatment yet recognised as effective. Success rates are being determined now for supportive care. The mortality rate is low, less than 3 per cent, and likely will be lower as more people fully recover. (According to the WHO, global fatality rate for SARS patients was at 11 per cent) Prof Gray: We don\u2019t know, but the good news is that so far the 2019-nCoV virus is not changing. Prof Wang: All viruses mutate in nature. But so far, the Wuhan coronavirus seems to be quite stable. Prof Gray: Ultraviolet light can often kill respiratory viruses. Prof Wang: No scientific evidence for that yet. Prof Neuman: As a person who likes to make anti-viral drugs, things that actually slow down the virus, I can say that (better weather patterns or health measures) are probably not going to be the end (of the virus outbreak). And a vaccine will probably not going to be the end. It\u2019s old-fashioned stuff like quarantines - basically keeping infected people away from healthy people that actually beat viruses like this. The risk is there are only so many quarantine facilities available in mainland China and only so many facilities to keep people properly treated while they are being treated for the virus. So if there are too many people that turn up sick, and overwhelm the systems that are there, that is potentially a risk. We\u2019ve seen China build new hospitals very quickly... so I believe they realise this possible risk and are trying to combat it - which is actually very good news. Prof Gray: I don\u2019t expect to see a quick resolution. We are seeing the epidemic expand into other countries now. Prof Wang: No expert can do such a prediction as this is a highly complex matter. Even the experts at WHO are monitoring and assessing daily.However, the next two weeks will be critical when the Chinese New Year holiday ends in China. If we see a decrease in two to three weeks, I am hopeful we can control this. Asst Prof Anderson: It is difficult to predict when the peak of infection will occur. If the quarantine measures are effective and patients can be isolated for 14 days, the outbreak should end.","summary":"SINGAPORE: The coronavirus originating from China\u2019s Wuhan city is spreading quickly in the country as well as across borders since it was first declared on the last day of 2019.

Prof Neuman: As a person who likes to make anti-viral drugs, things that actually slow down the virus, I can say that (better weather patterns or health measures) are probably not going to be the end (of the virus outbreak). The risk is there are only so many quarantine facilities available in mainland China and only so many facilities to keep people properly treated while they are being treated for the virus.

The company, which postponed the announcement date by more than two weeks to Feb 27, said the revised date would give it more time to observe the business condition for the first quarter of 2020. The virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has spread across the world and prompted many companies to close stores and restrict travel to and from the country. The fast-spreading virus has killed over 200 people. Baidu, whose search engine dominates the market in China, said it now expects fourth-quarter revenue in a range of 28.3 billion yuan (3.1 billion pounds) to 28.9 billion yuan, compared with its previous forecast of 27.1 billion yuan to 28.7 billion yuan.

Plus, they taste better and are better at protecting your health than supplements. Other than masks, immunity-boosting supplements are probably the next most-coveted items in the pharmacy aisles these days. And it makes sense, doesn\u2019t it? Your immune system is probably taking a beating from the stress of returning to work or getting Junior settled into the new school term. Boost your immune system and you\u2019re less likely to pick up an infection, whether it\u2019s the Wuhan coronavirus or the common cold, right? There is some evidence that micronutrient deficiencies such as zinc and folate, as well as Vitamins A, B6 and C, may alter immune responses in lab tests on animals, according to an article by Harvard Medical School. But to make up for the shortfall, you may be better off eating the right foods instead of popping supplement tablets. That\u2019s because the nutrients from food are the \u201cmost potent\u201d and \u201care accompanied by many non-essential but beneficial nutrients, such as hundreds of carotenoids, flavonoids, minerals and antioxidants that aren't in most supplements,\" said Dr Clifford Lo, an associate professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. Furthermore, relying on pills may cause you to overdose without realising it. Here\u2019s a look at some of the foods to consider adding to your meals. 1. BELL PEPPER Oranges aren\u2019t the only food packed with Vitamin C, that nutrient widely known for keeping infection at bay. Red bell peppers are a strong contender, and in fact, contain twice as much Vitamin C as citrus fruits. One medium-sized red bell pepper provides 169 per cent of your daily requirement (90mg for men and 75mg for women per day), wrote UK-registered dietitian Caroline Hill on Healthline. The red ones are the most nutritious because they've been on the vine the longest. Compared to the green peppers, reds contain 1.5 times more Vitamin C, eight times more Vitamin A and 11 times more beta carotene, according to the University of the District of Columbia\u2019s Center for Nutrition, Diet and Health. As for the yellow ones, their nutritional values are in between. 2. CHICKEN Zinc is present in every cell and is especially important for the development and function of immune cells. Animal sources of zinc such as chicken are better absorbed than plant ones such as legumes (chickpeas, lentils, kidney beans) and wholegrains (oat, quinoa, brown rice). This is because plants contain phytates that inhibit the absorption of zinc, according to the US Department of Health & Human Services. You don't need a lot of the mineral: 8mg for women and 11mg for men daily. An 85g-serving of chicken (about the size of a deck of cards) can provide about 2.4mg of zinc, according to Medical News Today. For the most nutritious cuts, choose skinless, lean meats with any visible fat removed. 3. MUSHROOMS Your immune system works best when there is sufficient glutathione to protect and help the cells in the immune system, such as the white blood cells, function. This potent antioxidant is produced by your body but with age, its level can drop, according to a study published in Integrative Medicine: A Clinician\u2019s Journal. Eating mushrooms is one way to top up your glutathione levels as certain species such as the porcini and white mushroom contain high quantities of the antioxidant. Fungi also have high levels of ergothioneine, an immune system-stimulating antioxidant, according to a study by Pennsylvania State University researchers that was published in Food Chemistry. Include a serving of mushrooms as part of your two servings of vegetables a day. 4. SPINACH Spinach made the list not just because it's rich in Vitamin C, it's also packed with antioxidants such as kaempferol and quercetin, which increase the infection-fighting ability of your immune system, according to Healthline. But make sure the leafy vegetable you\u2019re ordering from the economy rice stall isn\u2019t overcooked as the nutrients are easily destroyed by heat. Light cooking is all it takes to enhance its Vitamin A and allow other nutrients to be released from its oxalic acid. How much spinach to eat a day? A portion in your cai fan should be sufficient. 5. PAPAYA You probably don\u2019t eat a lot of papaya when you have exotic fruits such as acai and dragonfruit to choose from these days. It may be time to rethink the tropical fruit, which has 157 per cent of the daily recommended amount of Vitamin C in a single small fruit, according to US-registered dietitian Franziska Spritzler on Healthline. Papayas also have a digestion-friendly enzyme called papain that has anti-inflammatory effects, and not to mention, folate, B vitamins and Vitamin A in the form of carotenoids for the proper functioning of a healthy immune system. If you're not a big enough fan of papaya to finish a small, whole fruit by yourself, order a wedge from the fruit stall to cap off your meal instead. 6. YOGHURT Ok, so you've caught the cold despite your best efforts. Time for some yoghurt. This cold (a welcomed comfort when you have a fever), creamy treat is not only good for digestion, it is also great for lessening the severity of colds. Studies have shown that the probiotics in fermented foods help to improve the body\u2019s immune response, according to the Mayo Clinic. It also contains zinc, Vitamin A, calcium, potassium and carbohydrates to fuel your body and help you recover. Look for labels that say \"live and active cultures\" and for added Vitamin D as individuals with low Vitamin D levels may be more likely to get the cold or flu.","summary":"There is some evidence that micronutrient deficiencies such as zinc and folate, as well as Vitamins A, B6 and C, may alter immune responses in lab tests on animals, according to an article by Harvard Medical School.

In its daily update, the provincial health commission also said newly confirmed cases of infection in Hubei continued to grow at a steady pace, with 1,347. Nationwide there were 2,102 new cases as of Jan 31. That puts the national total at 11,791 as of Jan 31, according to the National Health Commission. Most of the country's deaths and overall cases have been in Hubei, a populous province in China's centre. The top Communist Party official in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million people where the virus first emerged in December, on Friday expressed \"remorse\" because local authorities acted too slowly. The virus is believed to have emerged in December in the provincial capital of Wuhan in a meat market that sold wild game.

NEW YORK: Concerns over the outbreak of coronavirus from China have largely overshadowed corporate results, but the back half of the earnings season could hold greater sway over the performance of individual stocks. Earnings-related stock moves have been smaller this season in comparison with the average over the past 12 quarters, according to data from options research company ORATS. The muted moves reflect a broader trend of subdued volatility that had limited price fluctuations in a range of assets over the last several months. Some of that calm was disrupted this week, as mounting concerns over the spread of the coronavirus on Friday dealt the benchmark S&P 500  stock index its biggest daily percentage loss since October. The dampened earnings-related moves have benefited options sellers, who profit when the change in share price is smaller than expected. Yet betting that earnings-related moves will remain subdued could soon become more costly. Options traders have priced in more volatility for broader exchange-traded funds. Implied volatility on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust , which shows expectations for future stock swings, has climbed since mid-January, according to data from Trade Alert. That rise coincides with mounting concerns over the potential economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. \"The options market is reflecting this new risk, this coronavirus risk,\" said Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive of Capital Market Laboratories in Los Angeles. Moreover, risks from the virus outbreak are beginning to spill over into earnings commentary. Companies such as Starbucks Corp , Levi Strauss & Co  and Oreos maker Mondelez International Inc  have warned of a financial hit from the outbreak. As such remarks pile up, they could also bump up volatility among shares of certain companies, Gottlieb said. \"Some CEOs are openly saying, 'Hey, things are going to be a little harder,'\" Gottlieb said. At the same time, the fourth and fifth weeks of the six-week earnings season have usually reaped the greatest rewards for traders buying options in anticipation of outsized stock moves, according to ORATS data. Earnings-related moves tend to be greater in those weeks in part because smaller companies, whose stocks are often more volatile, tend to report later in the season, said Matt Amberson, founder of ORATS, in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Options for several S&P 500  companies reporting next week - including Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc , Twitter Inc  and Coty Inc  - show a gap of several percentage points between investors' expectations for share moves and past share performance after quarterly reports. It appears that the cost of buying options on individual stocks ahead of a company's earnings report is \"getting cheaper when it should be getting more expensive,\" Amberson said.","summary":"Concerns over the outbreak of coronavirus from China have largely overshadowed corporate results, but the back half of the earnings season could hold greater sway over the performance of individual stocks.

The new facility is better placed to handle the Wuhan coronavirus situation, she noted. The NCID, which officially opened in September last year, has more than 330 isolation rooms at its Jalan Tan Tock Seng location. Between November 2002 and July 2003, SARS affected 8,098 people worldwide, resulting in 774 deaths across 17 countries. In Singapore, 238 were infected, resulting in the deaths of 33 people here. For her work in tackling the SARS crisis, Dr Ang received the National Day Award (Medal of Valour) and the Courage Medal. Dr Ang - who also chairs Tan Tock Seng Hospital\u2019s infection control committee \u2013 also played a role in controlling the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Eighteen people died in that outbreak here.

Singapore now has 16 confirmed cases of the virus, including a 47-year-old Singaporean who travelled to Wuhan with her family. In dealing with the virus, Singapore has learned many lessons from dealing with SARS 17 years ago, she said. \u201cEach outbreak is different, but the core principles remain the same.\u201d These include \u201cvery strict compliance with infection control measures\u201d, as well as ensuring accurate information gets disseminated to stem rumours and misinformation. \u201cPart of the reaction to any outbreak response is managing fears on the ground, as well as coming up with relevant recommendations,\u201d she noted.

SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook Inc  said it will take down misinformation about China's fast-spreading coronavirus, in a rare departure from its usual approach to dubious health content that is presenting a fresh challenge for social media companies. The coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe. Hoaxes have spread widely online, promoted by conspiracy theorists and exacerbated by a dearth of information from the cordoned-off zone around China's central city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began. Nearly 12,000 people have been infected in China, according to local health authorities, and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions. Facebook said in a blog post that it would remove content about the virus \"with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities,\" saying such content would violate its ban on misinformation leading to \"physical harm.\" The move is unusually aggressive for the world's biggest social network, which generally limits the distribution of content containing health misinformation to its 2.9 billion monthly users through restrictions on search results and advertising, but allows the original posts to stay up. It also puts it at odds with other major U.S.-based social networks. Alphabet Inc's  YouTube, which has 2 billion monthly users and Twitter  and Reddit, which have hundreds of millions of users, confirmed they do not consider inaccurate information about health to be a violation of their policies. Those companies, like Facebook in other cases, rely on techniques such as elevating medical information from authoritative public health sources and warning users about content that has been debunked. TikTok, owned by China's Bytedance, and Pinterest Inc  do ban health misinformation and are actively removing false coronavirus content, they told Reuters. Fact-checking initiative PolitiFact said misinformation about the virus online included hoaxes about its source, its spread, and how to treat it, as well as false conspiracies about its connection to biological warfare and the Chinese government. Rumors about the coronavirus have also spread widely on Chinese social networks, which are usually quick to remove sensitive content but have in recent days allowed an unusual level of public criticism over the government's handling of the crisis. Information in China is tightly controlled, and Chinese laws dictate that rumor-mongers can face years in prison. In the early days of the outbreak, Chinese state media reported that police in Wuhan had detained eight people for spreading rumors about a \"local outbreak of unidentifiable pneumonia.\" Suspicion also lingers over accusations that Beijing initially covered up the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. A spokeswoman for Tencent Holdings Inc's  Chinese messaging app WeChat, which has 1.15 billion monthly users, told Reuters the company was removing posts containing coronavirus-related misinformation. The U.S. tech industry's mostly hands-off approach has angered critics who say social media companies have failed to curb the spread of medical inaccuracies that pose major global health threats. In particular, misinformation about vaccination has proliferated on social media in many countries in recent years, including during major vaccination campaigns to prevent polio in Pakistan and to immunize against yellow fever in South America. Facebook, under fierce scrutiny worldwide in recent years over its privacy and content practices, has previously removed vaccine misinformation in Samoa, where a measles outbreak killed dozens late last year. The spread of illness there was so severe that the company classified anti-vaccination content a risk of physical harm, a spokeswoman told Reuters, calling the move an \"extreme action.\" The coronavirus and Samoa decisions indicate Facebook is expanding its definition of \"physical harm\" to include misinformation contributing to the rapid spread of illness. The company did not say whether it had acted in a similar way in other cases. It removed misinformation about polio vaccines in Pakistan, but the imminent harm in that case involved risks of violence against the health workers carrying out the immunization campaigns, the spokeswoman said.","summary":"Facebook Inc said it will take down misinformation about China's fast-spreading coronavirus, in a rare departure from its usual approach to dubious health content that is presenting a fresh challenge for social media companies.

Previously, only those with recent travel history to Hubei province were subjected to these restrictions. In addition, those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents and long-term pass holders, will not be allowed to enter Singapore. Authorities will also stop issuing all forms of new visas and suspend previously issued short-term and multiple-visit visas for those with Chinese passports. Those who hold such visas will not be allowed into Singapore. The multi-ministry task force tackling the outbreak said these measures will help prevent community spread in Singapore, hours before the Ministry of Health announced the country's three latest confirmed cases of the virus.

But that's one of the few certainties they have, says the Financial Times' Tom Hancock. LONDON: As our Boeing 747 from the Chinese city of Wuhan touched down at a military base in Oxfordshire on Friday (Jan 31) lunchtime, the overwhelming emotion was concern. This was no ordinary flight. The passengers on board had been trapped in a city sealed off from the outside world, shut down by Chinese authorities struggling to get to grips with the coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 200 people and spread panic around the world. Two weeks ago I arrived in Wuhan to cover the virus outbreak for the Financial Times. But what started as a regular assignment quickly turned into a surreal captivity. On Friday, 110 people were allowed to leave by air as part of an evacuation effort. One of my fellow passengers was an unaccompanied three-year-old girl who had been staying with her grandparents in Wuhan while her parents were in the UK. She was cared for on the flight by staff from the UK Foreign Office. The eldest was Veronica Theobald, an 81-year-old from Lancaster, who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and who was taken to the flight in a wheelchair. Our flight\u2019s departure had been shrouded in uncertainty until the last minute and was originally meant to have left on Thursday morning. When the call came, we only had a few hours to get to a meeting point near Wuhan airport. Like my fellow passengers I wore a face mask throughout most of the journey. For other passengers, leaving the centre of the outbreak was mixed with uncertainty about the future and the lives they have left behind. \u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet,\u201d Emma Wang, a Chinese national travelling with her British partner and three-month-old baby, told me. \u201cI like living in Wuhan but the situation there is difficult for us, there\u2019s a lot of sick people,\u201d Dani Carmona, a Spaniard who had been working as a football coach in Wuhan, told me. He had to leave his girlfriend behind. \u201cIt was a difficult decision,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, I will come back to Wuhan as soon as I can.\u201d The cabin crew also wore masks and gloves during the 12-hour flight. One female attendant, who did not wish to be named, revealed that she would not earn extra money for the job. \u201cI want to help people wherever they\u2019re from,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re on three-month contracts, so it might have been possible to say \u2018no\u2019 to doing this flight, but it could have meant losing work in future.\u201d \u201cI feel it can\u2019t be too dangerous, as the British government wouldn\u2019t put us at risk,\u201d she added. As we neared the UK, a Foreign Office official told us that the flight was \u201cnothing short of remarkable\u201d given the logistical issues, including \u201cobstacles thrown by Beijing\u201d. When we landed there was no clapping or cheering from the passengers, who included 27 EU nationals as well as pilots and a Spanish crew. None of the passengers on board had shown symptoms of the flu-like coronavirus before boarding, the flight attendants said. And none of the passengers became ill during the time in the air. After we left the plane, the flight took off again for Spain. For those of us who disembarked at Brize Norton, two weeks of quarantine await. There is no such certainty for the millions still in Wuhan.","summary":"Having defied logistical obstacles to leave, evacuees now face two weeks in quarantine.

Just a handful of tourists, many wearing face masks, strolled through the area during daylight hours this week. In the evening, foot traffic increased a little under the glow of the red lanterns strung across the thoroughfare, but remained far below normal levels. \"The impact is tremendous,\" 45-year old Ausana Akaradachakul told Reuters as she waited behind the counter for shoppers in her store selling postcards, straw bags, clothing and jewellery. \"Only a few days after the news broke about the virus, the Chinese tourists were visibly few,\" Akaradachakul said. \"I think about 70per cent of them are gone.\" The beach resort of Phuket is Thailand's second most visited destination after Bangkok and is usually a big draw for visitors from China, who accounted for 11 million visitors last year, particularly around the Lunar New Year holiday.

Reduced travel from China alone could result in 50 billion baht (US$1.52 billion) of lost tourism revenue, the Thai Tourism Ministry estimated.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - which also began in China - killed almost 800 people worldwide in 2002-2003, with the Chinese government drawing condemnation for attempting to cover up the outbreak. But dramatic lifestyle changes mean this epidemic is shaping up differently. Here are five ways life in China has changed since SARS: Rising incomes have turned China into the world's biggest source of outbound tourists over the past decade, according to the World Tourism Organization, and Chinese tourists are a huge source of revenue for many countries. They made almost 150 million trips abroad in 2018 - nearly ten times the 16.6 million made in 2002, according to tourism ministry figures. The travel boom has complicated efforts to control the spread of the novel coronavirus, with Chinese authorities urging citizens on Tuesday to delay trips abroad. China's online population grew from 68 million in 2003 to 829 million in 2018, according to the country's cyberspace authority. The popularity of social media platforms Weibo and WeChat has fuelled misinformation and memes alike, with users heading online to share bogus remedies for the virus and shame inept local officials. The internet has also become a battleground between authorities keen to maintain stability and citizens alleging a cover-up. Eight people were reprimanded by Wuhan police for allegedly publishing untrue claims on WeChat that SARS had re-emerged in the city, while hundreds of other people across the country have received punishments for \"spreading rumours\", according to rights group Chinese Human Rights Defenders. But China's top court later admonished Wuhan for its heavy-handed response to the rumours, saying the city might have benefited from greater alarm earlier in the crisis. China became a majority urban country in 2011, with the country's population of internal migrants nearly doubling from 2005 to 2018 to reach more than 240 million, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Every year the world's biggest travel rush takes place in China as workers head back home for the Lunar New Year from the cities where they work. The timing of the coronavirus outbreak around the Spring Festival period has complicated efforts to control its spread. Authorities have set up temperature checkpoints at airports and train stations across the country and extended the long holiday by two days. Millions of migrant workers are also locked out of public healthcare systems by strict urban registration rules. With growing internet and smartphone use, Chinese people's everyday actions are increasingly being mined for data by the government and corporations. Beijing has come under increasing scrutiny for high-tech surveillance - from facial recognition-enabled security cameras to apps used by police to extract personal information from smartphones at checkpoints. China's railway authority on Thursday said it had set up a dedicated team to trawl through data and track down close contacts of infected train passengers. At the time of the SARS outbreak, Chinese consumers shopped almost exclusively at brick-and-mortar stores and malls, with only 0.07 per cent of shopping in 2003 done online, according to the UN Industrial Development Organization. Now, e-commerce and local delivery apps have become commonplace in Chinese cities, and citizens worried about the coronavirus can choose to shop online instead of stepping foot in crowded stores.","summary":"BEIJING: A new coronavirus originating from central China has killed 259 people and infected thousands others, stirring memories of the SARS outbreak nearly two decades ago.

A second Xiamen flight landed soon afterwards carrying Hubei residents from Kota Kinabalu, a popular coastal tourist destination in Malaysia.

The number of visitors to the world's largest casino hub has plunged nearly 80 per cent in the past week, transforming the city into a shadow of its former self. As the only place in China that allows gambling, the former Portuguese colony is normally a huge draw for people from other parts of the vast country. But on the sixth day of the holiday, only several dozen people were seen at the usually teeming ruins of the 17th-century St Paul's church - a tourist hotspot. Most wore surgical masks as a preventative measure against the novel coronavirus, which has infected almost 12,000 people across the nation. \"Everyone is wearing a mask. It is not convenient to take pictures - we dare not remove the masks,\" 23-year-old Wei I Ting, a tourist from Taiwan, told AFP. Shotah Zhang, who owns a pastry shop, said he was worried about the future of his business. \"As you can see, almost no one is here. We have quite a big problem because we are a small business,\" Zhang said. The outbreak is dealing a heavy blow to Macau's economy, which has bet most of its chips on gambling and tourism. Figures for January show gaming revenue fell 11.3 per cent on the same month last year. The city had confirmed seven cases of the virus as of Saturday and authorities have announced measures to curb its spread, including temperature checks and mandatory health declarations for visitors at the border with mainland China. In casinos, all staff have been ordered to wear masks and temperature checks are being carried out at entrances. The government has also banned anyone who has visited Hubei province - the epicentre of the outbreak - from entering casinos altogether. But a 24-year-old marketing supervisor for a coffee shop was more hopeful. \"We believe that after the virus is gone, customers will come back,\" she said.","summary":"MACAU: Macau is usually bustling with gamblers during the Chinese New Year holiday but the flood of tourists has been reduced to a trickle this year as fears grow over a coronavirus that has killed almost 260 people.

The Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a joint press release on Saturday that these sectors have been affected by a decline in air traffic through Changi and an increase in hotel room cancellations. Speaking to reporters at Shangri-la Rasa Sentosa after meeting staff there to find out how they are dealing with the situation, Mr Heng warned of a broader slowdown across the economy. \"For that, we will have a strong Budget in 2020,\" he said.

Feb 2 this year is being considered a lucky date for wedding ceremonies because the sequence of numbers \"02022020\" reads the same backwards as forwards. Beijing, Shanghai and other cities had earlier decided to offer wedding registry services on the date, despite it falling on a Sunday (Feb 2) when offices are usually closed. The ministry said it would temporarily halt marriage counselling services and asked the public not to hold wedding banquets. It also said funerals should be held in a \"simple and expeditious manner to avoid gatherings of people\" and the bodies of any victims of the coronavirus should be cremated as soon as possible. Staff handling funerals should wear protective gear and carry out temperature checks to avoid risking infection, the statement added. China has introduced drastic travel restrictions and pushed back the end of the Chinese New Year break - when hundreds of millions of people travel across the country to visit family - in a bid to contain the virus. Schools and universities nationwide have been told not to resume classes, officials have urged factories to delay their return to work and the public has been asked to avoid large crowds. More than 50 million people in Hubei province, where the virus was first detected, are effectively locked down after authorities severed transport links.

As for the 16 previously announced cases, none is critically ill. All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving,\" MOH said. The 17th case is a 47 year-old female Singapore citizen who travelled to Wuhan. \"She was one of the Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30, and arrived in Singapore on the same day. She was asymptomatic when she boarded the flight. \"Upon arrival at Changi Airport, she was found to have a fever during medical screening, and was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID),\" MOH said. The woman then tested positive for Wuhan coronavirus infection on Jan 31 at about 11pm. She is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID.

He reported that he had stayed at his home at Nathan Road until Jan 29, when he took a taxi to SGH. He was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated. Subsequent test results confirmed 2019-nCoV infection on Jan 31 at about 2pm, MOH said. As of 12pm on Feb 1, MOH said 231 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus. Test results for the remaining 25 cases are pending and contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH said it will closely monitor all close contacts and quarantine them for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient as a precautionary measure. All other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status. So far, MOH said it has identified 245 close contacts. Of the 177 who are still in Singapore, 172 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining five close contacts. MOH also advised Singaporeans to defer all travel to Hubei province and all non-essential travel to mainland China. \"All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. \"Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (eg. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit,\" MOH said. MOH added that it will continue to monitor the situation closely. \"As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated.\" Singapore on Friday announced that it will widen travel restrictions to include all new visitors with recent travel history to China. China also said it will send charter planes to bring home citizens from Hubei who are overseas \"as soon as possible\". The announcement came as a number of airlines, including Singapore Airlines and Scoot, announced they were halting or reducing flights to China as the country tackles the spread of the virus.

Speaking at a Chinese New Year Celebration in Teck Ghee, Mr Lee said that everyone is concerned about the coronavirus as some may recall when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) hit Singapore in 2003. \u201cWe did not know how long it would last, and we worried about our loved ones being infected. But we stayed united and dealt with the crisis together.\" Since then, Mr Lee said that Singapore has become better prepared with medical facilities like the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and healthcare professionals who are trained to deal with this scenario. \u201cSo I have every confidence that we can overcome the challenge before us,\u201d he said. Referring to Singapore\u2019s decision to restrict entry to new visitors of any nationality with recent travel history to mainland China, Mr Lee said it was a pre-emptive measure taken purely to protect Singapore\u2019s public health. He added that China is doing all it can to contain the coronavirus spread, including imposing their own travel restrictions within China, cancelling outbound tour groups and bringing back Hubei residents from overseas. \u201cIt is a much stronger response than they took when SARS first broke out, so our efforts ... will complement China\u2019s efforts,\" he said. \"We wish China well in their efforts to fight the virus,\u201d Mr Lee added. Regrettably, sentiment against those from the People\u2019s Republic of China has emerged in the last few days in many countries, said Mr Lee, adding that such sentiments are \u201cnot helpful at all\u201d. \u201cThe virus may have started in China but it doesn\u2019t respect nationality or race. It doesn't check your passport before it goes into your body and anybody can be infected.\" Mr Lee stressed that the coronavirus situation should be seen as a public health issue and not as a race or international diplomatic problem. Mr Lee noted that while the situation with the new coronavirus bears some similarities to SARS, it also is somewhat different. The new virus seems to be less lethal than SARS but is also more infectious. Patient may also be asymptomatic when they are infectious, which makes detection difficult. Hence, Mr Lee said that Singapore has to work harder to isolate suspect cases as soon as they are identified, and contain the virus from spreading in the community. Another difference from SARS is that Singapore did not have social media back then. In a crisis, Mr Lee said social media has been both a boon and a bane as there is now a lot more information circulating online, on WhatsApp and on Facebook, including misleading rumours and false information. Mr Lee said some of these go viral because people are anxious and want to share information without verifying it. Such rumours can easily amplify anxieties and make it harder for people to get the correct information they need, and can even spark fear and panic, he added. \u201cSo I strongly advise everybody, if you hear something shocking ... check with proper channels, check from trusted places.\u201d Members of the public can also subscribe to the Government WhatsApp channel to get the latest updates. Mr Lee said everyone can also play their part to be responsible for their own and their families\u2019 safety by practising good personal hygiene and washing their hands frequently. Those who have a fever, or show symptoms of a cold, should put on a mask and see the doctor. \u201cWe know that some of you are worried as you could not buy your own masks.\" For those who need them, Mr Lee said each household can collect a pack of four masks from their neighbourhood RCs, in stages starting from Saturday. Mr Lee ended his speech by calling on Singapore to remain resilient and calm, respond to the situation as one united nation, and \u201cshow care and concern for our fellow human beings\u201d.

On Saturday, their first morning there, some were up to take in the sunrise, others sat outside in the mild weather reading while others explored inside the hotel complex. \"There are worse places,\" said Marc Ziltman with a smile, as children's shouts echoed across the facility. \"The easy solution would have been a disused barracks,\" Zilman, the senior Red Cross official on site, pointed out. Instead, the French authorities opted to make the evacuees stay as comfortable as possible. \"The site needs to be as agreeable as possible because people are going to pass 14 days there,\" he told AFP. There is volleyball for the teenagers, art classes for the toddlers and a space for the grown-ups to relax over a coffee, making it more holiday resort than hospital or clinic. For the moment, no one here has shown any symptoms that could indicate they have caught the new coronavirus. Two possible cases identified as the evacuees came off their plane on Friday tested negative at La Timone hospital in Marseille. The medical team looking after the evacuees is about 20 strong, including doctors, nurses and psychologists. Backing them are are soldiers from France's civil security units and 30 Red Cross volunteers, who mainly take care of the logistics of their stay. On their first day back on Saturday, the new arrivals got down to solving the immediate challenges raised by their rather hasty repatriation: how to do their laundry, change their Chinese currency and get hold of cigarettes. A concierge service was already up and running to attend to their needs. \"Yesterday, they were tired, which is quite normal,\" said Zyltman. They had their evening meal and went quietly to bed. \"Now, life is back on course and it's going rather well,\" he added.

So I\u2019m taking action","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/commentary\/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-parents-schools-precautions-measures-12374280","article":"News of the Wuhan coronavirus have created anxiety and fear among parents. June Yong admits she shares some of these sentiments but shares her experience on what\u2019s getting her through. SINGAPORE: Over the past week or so, the spotlight shifted very quickly from Chinese New Year festivities to the deadly coronavirus. As a parent with three kids in primary school, I couldn\u2019t help but feel on the edge as the day to return to school post-CNY drew near. News about the compulsory leave of absence (LOA) for teachers and students returning from China helped settle the jitters somewhat but did not remove it completely. I was also in a dilemma. As my second child was still recovering from a flu bug, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure whether he was well enough to return to school. In the end, I kept all three at home on the first day. To be absolutely honest, I\u2019m not sure if it was more responsible parenting or paranoia driving that decision. Apparently I wasn\u2019t the only one who was gripped by fear, as a few of my daughter\u2019s classmates were absent on that day too. But when she begged to go to school the next day, I relented. In the movie Inside Out, we get an insider perspective of what goes on in the emotional world of Riley, the main character of the show. It was fascinating to watch how each of her five basic emotions \u2014 Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger \u2014 took control at the console of her mind. In today\u2019s virus-warped world, it is apparent that Fear is in the driver\u2019s seat. This is the primary emotion that is causing people to grab and hoard masks, despite the government\u2019s call to use them responsibly and only when feeling unwell. It is the emotion driving restaurant owners in Korea to put up signs saying \u201cno Chinese allowed\u201d. It is also the emotion that is causing us to think twice about sending our children to school. Now it is perfectly normal to be fearful, given that there are a lot of unknowns about this virus: When it is contagious \u2014 upon infection or post-symptom, how it is transmitted, who are most at risk, and how long it will take to die down. The accelerating pace of the virus spread in China and around the world is also making it hard to get a handle on the situation. As parents, we worry that the situation will turn south very quickly, and we don\u2019t want to see our offspring suffering needlessly. So we pull out all the stops to ensure their safety, whether it is by keeping them home, driving them to and from school, skipping unnecessary events, or getting them masks. More than a week back, many of us also called on the Government to take action and prevent Hubei nationals and travellers from entering Singapore when the situation took a turn for the worse, a move that was eventually made. Last Thursday, I brought my boys for their usual badminton lessons and we practically had the entire hall to ourselves. We all hope that the virus will disappear in weeks, and that it will neither run the months-long course as SARS nor come anywhere close to the impact it had. But one thing seems certain: We have not seen the peak yet, and the number of infected cases around the world is going to rise. Elsewhere including the US, community spread has already occurred. Experts are saying the virus may continue for the next few months given how fast it\u2019s been spreading. My WhatsApp chat groups have been buzzing with information shared by parents on how to protect ourselves and where to get masks, sanitisers and anti-bacterial wipes. While mostly useful, it also induces anxiety. The past week, I\u2019ve noticed moments when I felt harried and breathless, and I think it could be my body\u2019s stress response. In the first few days of the newsbreak, I also found myself using negative terms such as \u201cyour immunity will be weak\u201d or \u201cthe virus will make you very sick\u201d in a bid to scare them into washing their hands properly before meals. I\u2019ve since tried to be more measured in my word choices, so as not to create greater anxiety in my kids, using a more positive tone such as \u201clet\u2019s keep ourselves healthy during this period\u201d. It may seem small in the scheme of things but this is the time to exercise leadership and role-modelling as parents. Part of this is to avoid stressing our kids out unduly. When a perceived threat is imminent and unknown, we will all experience a period of heightened fear and irrational behaviour. Because of the scarcity of masks or other health-related goods, people start to eye one another suspiciously. Every sneeze or slight clearing of throat is enough to get you stares on public transport. Caution is certainly needed but we may need time to adjust and allow other healthier emotions to take their rightful place at the wheel, perhaps those of perseverance, hope and level-headedness. In this regard, we could learn from the Japanese. Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. Children there are taught earthquake survival skills early on in their lives. Schools run regular earthquake drills, educating kids on the best way to stay safe during an earthquake. One common strategy taught is for children to get under their desks and hold onto their table legs until the trembling is over. If playing outside, children are taught to go to the centre of an open space to avoid falling objects. Since we will need time to bring the virus to heel, we should instill good hygiene habits in our young. From washing hands properly, to practising good cough etiquette by covering your mouth or using a mask, and handling and disposing masks carefully \u2014 if we train them up well in these areas, as a society we will enjoy stronger defences against the coronavirus and future viruses as well. Along with staying home if one is ill instead of heading out, these are good habits we should instill in our children irrespective of news of this pandemic. When I picked the kids up after school last week, I asked if their teachers had encouraged them to wash their hands, or given them more water breaks to hydrate their bodies. I was a tad disappointed to hear that there were no such exhortations. Granted, even if the teachers instruct, kids being kids, some may not take these seriously and just do a cursory wash. So parents cannot abdicate our responsibility in drilling our kids. Given the potential danger a community spread in schools could cause, I think more can be done in the area of educating our children on hygiene and viral protection. Experts have emphasised that this battle will not be won on the back of masks or sanitisers, but one\u2019s level of personal hygiene. Dr Leong Hoe Nam, Infectious Disease Specialist humorously shared his golden rule in a radio interview: \u201cDon\u2019t touch your face. Your face is sacred.\u201d I told this to my children and they laughed; I certainly hope it makes the message stick. I think schools have done well thus far in keeping parents abreast of the latest protective measures. Apart from daily temperature taking and implementing the LOA, they can also consider using curriculum time set aside for Health Education or PAL (Programme for Active Learning) to inculcate healthy hygiene habits. We do not know how this pandemic will pan out, but we can control our thoughts and choices today. By all means, take the necessary precautions but in order to emerge unscathed through this crisis, we need to balance fear with equal doses of calm, wit and trust. By practising good hygiene habits as a family, we can go about our daily lives like the Japanese children, with hope and optimism while constantly vigilant for the next alarm. If we manage ourselves well, this crisis could turn out to be an opportunity for us and our children to learn a kind of resilience that could shelter Singapore for years to come \u2014 no matter what virus mutations come our way.

BEIJING: On the eve of Chinese New Year, I set off from Beijing for my grandparents\u2019 home in northern China. It is the day after the city of Wuhan has in effect been placed under quarantine. I am headed some 600km from Wuhan, but this New Year holiday is very different: Almost everyone on the train from Beijing is wearing a face mask. I take mine off when I arrive at my grandparents\u2019 crowded flat, where they, along with a total of seven aunts, uncles and cousins, are already folding dumplings for the pot. They are chatting about the virus outbreak, but the mood is still calm. Everyone is busy dealing with a more immediate concern: Making dinner for a large family. So far, only Wuhan has taken city-wide preventive measures, but we are now discussing our own. To some relief, my grandparents announce they are cancelling our usual visits to relatives. Like me, some travellers managed to reach home before transport links started shutting down, and are at least holed up with loved ones. But for late travellers, those who cancelled travel plans out of fear of contagion and transport disruption, let alone the 9 million people stuck in Wuhan, the situation is far worse. For many in China, the New Year is the only time in the year they see their parents and even their children. China is a country of long-distance internal migrants. Go back one or two generations, and most people\u2019s families were subsistence farmers living in the countryside. Over the past 50 years, a vast rural-urban migration has spread those families across the country. Those who are lucky enough to go to university often settle down in the big cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and smaller provincial capitals. Those who don\u2019t settle in the cities go everywhere as migrant workers fuelling the low-paid casual labour of China\u2019s economic development. Because the government makes it very difficult for migrant workers to access education in the cities, many leave their children with relatives in the countryside, and visit them at New Year. So Chinese New Year is a crucial annual migration that is easier for some than for others. Rail tickets sell out quickly, and those with the money might buy plane tickets instead. Many migrant workers travel by long-distance bus \u2013 the same services that multiple provinces have since suspended in the wake of the virus outbreak. One of my father\u2019s cousins drives for three days or more, covering 4,000km each way. On the first day of the holiday, we make plans to visit my grandparents\u2019 old farmstead the next day, to sweep my great-grandma\u2019s grave and light firecrackers for her. As we were making plans, however, Beijing announced it will stop long-distance buses going into the city. The next morning, we wake to the news that our county has started asking its villages to block their road entrances, and that public bus services from the city are being suspended.  Across China, other friends tell me of villages and townships embarking on self-quarantine in the national spirit of viral defence. Much of it may be over-zealous, as there is an ongoing debate over the effectiveness of government-imposed city-level quarantines. Borders are always leaky, and quarantines give possible viral carriers a reason to lie about their whereabouts. In my grandparents\u2019 old village of some 500 people, there have been no coronavirus victims to date. There are 70 detected infections in their province of 80 million people. As the news landscape shifts, my relatives now discuss preventive measures with more urgency than before. But news of spurious quality proliferates both online and offline. One of my uncles recommends that we all chew garlic to stave off the virus. As he describes the idea, I recognise it as coming from a much-shared article on WeChat, China\u2019s main social-messaging platform and incubator of various unreliable articles over the viral outbreak. There are a few peer-reviewed studies on the possible antiviral properties of garlic, but I doubt the author or sharers of that article had gone to the trouble of looking them up. More pernicious rumours floated on the Chinese internet, such as the old rumour that SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) had been manufactured by the US to specifically target Chinese people. The English-language internet is hardly much better. An old video of a street protest is recirculated as if happening now in Wuhan (untrue), and a video of Wuhan with firecrackers going off in the background is flaunted as evidence of police shooting people trying to leave (also untrue). Much social media commentary is overlaid with disgust at Chinese people as a racial group and over their eating habits. The worst part of the outbreak, for many of my friends, is the terrifying headlines they feel compelled to consume about it, which leave you feeling powerless and panicked. On social media, some share tips of varying helpfulness for staying safe, while others share a petition to extend the national holiday, or even lists of places in Beijing where virus victims are said to be staying. Some simply wish their friends were well, and hope we stay calm. Out of the dozens of articles I\u2019ve read about the virus, I can only condense one helpful piece of advice: Wash your hands properly and dry them on clean towels. On my second morning at my grandparents\u2019, my uncle suggests that I go back to Beijing early, fearing more transport options would be shut down as the holiday went on. I pack my suitcase quickly, glad that the load is lightened by the presents I\u2019ve offloaded. But I have forgotten to reckon with the customary food parcels from my aunt. The next morning, as I leave for Beijing, she hands me a heavy bag packed with northern Chinese staples: steamed buns stuffed with sweet bean paste, salted duck eggs, breaded cabbage, deep-fried meatballs, and an entire cooked rooster. She thrusts on me another bag filled with a dozen pink apples and a dozen oranges, saying I can eat them on the way. I am running out of hands to carry it all. \u201cIt\u2019s a three-hour train ride,\u201d I reply, laughing, \u201cI can\u2019t eat that many oranges in three hours.\u201d \u201cBeijing is a big city. Beijing has oranges,\u201d I say, leaving the second bag behind. My uncle\u2019s friend drives us to the railway station, as the local buses have been suspended. As we pull in to the station, he reminds us: \u201cPut on your masks \u2013 I hear they\u2019re not letting people in without them.\u201d On the way home, I message friends on WeChat, telling them I\u2019m returning early. Two of them invite me to their dinner parties, joking that Chinese grain liquor will help disinfect our throats. I hesitate for hours before replying, wondering whether a yes or no would be overly cautious, rude or irresponsible. How are you meant to assess the risk of going to see friends, when you\u2019re probably more likely to be killed from a traffic accident on the way there than from the coronavirus, yet people around you are panicking? Back in Beijing, the city streets are emptier than they usually are in the new year\u2019s holiday week. But there are reassuring signs of normal life: I brush past green-coated guards still marching in formation around the embassy district, now with face masks on. Through a restaurant window, I see a few people eating Beijing barbeque skewers. And on the streets, the city\u2019s migrant workers are still busy: Delivering, cleaning, hurrying everywhere. When I arrive at my apartment block, the guard at the gate to the compound hands me a pink slip of paper from the local district government. It tells us to register ourselves if we have been to coronavirus-infected areas, to wear masks outside and to keep warm. \u201cWe can\u2019t cut corners on preventive measures,\u201d the paper reads, \u201cbut we also don\u2019t need to panic.\u201d The next morning, I venture out for groceries. In the cramped convenience store on my block, I am the only customer, but there are bags filled with other people\u2019s groceries standing on the till. As I enter, a delivery man dressed in blue electric-scooter gear is leaving. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019re mostly out of fresh vegetables,\u201d the shopkeeper says, seeing me enter. I\u2019ll have to walk a bit further to a larger supermarket to get mine. \u201cWe\u2019ve had very few customers in person, but we\u2019re getting all these delivery requests,\u201d she adds. As she explains, her smartphone\u2019s loudspeaker blares out another order. This shop, like most small shops in big cities, has understocked for the New Year holiday, expecting a dearth of customers. \u201cWe plan to restock in a week, but really, I don\u2019t think the shipments will come through for another two weeks,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere do you get your food from?\u201d I ask, thinking of the farmland around Beijing and the villages that have sealed off their roads. \u201cWhere it\u2019s produced,\u201d she replies, flatly, as if speaking of places that do not need to be spoken of. I fish out a couple of apples from a small crate on the shop floor. I wish I had taken my aunt\u2019s oranges.

As we were making plans, however, Beijing announced it will stop long-distance buses going into the city. The next morning, we wake to the news that our county has started asking its villages to block their road entrances, and that public bus services from the city are being suspended. Across China, other friends tell me of villages and townships embarking on self-quarantine in the national spirit of viral defence. In my grandparents\u2019 old village of some 500 people, there have been no coronavirus victims to date. The worst part of the outbreak, for many of my friends, is the terrifying headlines they feel compelled to consume about it, which leave you feeling powerless and panicked. On social media, some share tips of varying helpfulness for staying safe, while others share a petition to extend the national holiday, or even lists of places in Beijing where virus victims are said to be staying. On my second morning at my grandparents\u2019, my uncle suggests that I go back to Beijing early, fearing more transport options would be shut down as the holiday went on. The next morning, as I leave for Beijing, she hands me a heavy bag packed with northern Chinese staples: steamed buns stuffed with sweet bean paste, salted duck eggs, breaded cabbage, deep-fried meatballs, and an entire cooked rooster. She thrusts on me another bag filled with a dozen pink apples and a dozen oranges, saying I can eat them on the way. \u201cIt\u2019s a three-hour train ride,\u201d I reply, laughing, \u201cI can\u2019t eat that many oranges in three hours.\u201d \u201cBeijing is a big city. Beijing has oranges,\u201d I say, leaving the second bag behind. As we pull in to the station, he reminds us: \u201cPut on your masks \u2013 I hear they\u2019re not letting people in without them.\u201d On the way home, I message friends on WeChat, telling them I\u2019m returning early. How are you meant to assess the risk of going to see friends, when you\u2019re probably more likely to be killed from a traffic accident on the way there than from the coronavirus, yet people around you are panicking? Back in Beijing, the city streets are emptier than they usually are in the new year\u2019s holiday week. Through a restaurant window, I see a few people eating Beijing barbeque skewers. This shop, like most small shops in big cities, has understocked for the New Year holiday, expecting a dearth of customers.","datetime":1580623560000,"date_time":1580682521000},{"title":"US confirms its eighth case of coronavirus, quarantine in effect","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/news\/world\/wuhan-coronavirus-us-eighth-case-quarantine-12381350","article":"REUTERS: US health officials on Saturday (Feb 1) confirmed an eighth case of the fast-spreading new coronavirus in the United States in a person who had travelled to China. The latest US patient, who was not identified, is in Massachusetts, a spokeswoman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in an emailed statement. The person recently returned from Hubei province in central China, the epicenter of the outbreak. No other details were provided. The flu-like coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in a market that traded illegally in wildlife in Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei, has so far resulted in 259 deaths in China, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Saturday. All but one of the patients in the United States was believed to have contracted the disease while they were travelling in the Wuhan area of China. US officials this week reported the first human-to-human transmission of the disease in the United States in Illinois. Nearly 12,000 people have been infected globally, according to the WHO, with all but just over 130 of those cases occurring in China. Concerns about the spread of the virus spurred the Trump administration to declare a public health emergency and bar entry to the United States of foreign nationals who have recently visited China. Despite that, US health officials have said risks to the United States remain low. In addition, US citizens who have travelled within the past two weeks to Hubei will be subject to a mandatory quarantine of 14 days, believed to be the incubation period of the virus, officials said. Americans who visited other parts of mainland China will undergo special health screening upon their return, followed by up to 14 days of \"monitored self-quarantine,\" under the temporary restrictions. The first quarantines of US citizens potentially exposed to coronavirus in China began hours before the White House announcement on Friday. Nearly 200 Americans evacuated earlier this week from Wuhan and voluntarily confined to a California military air base for 72 hours of health screenings were placed under a mandatory 14-day quarantine on Friday. It marked the CDC's first quarantine order in 50 years.","summary":"REUTERS: US health officials on Saturday (Feb 1) confirmed an eighth case of the fast-spreading new coronavirus in the United States in a person who had travelled to China.

The deadly virus has killed over 250 people in China so far. The Wuhan metropolis is at the heart of the SARS-like virus epidemic that has led the World Health Organization to declare it an international public health emergency. The city of 11 million has been subject to an unprecedented lockdown, preventing residents from leaving in a bid to stop the virus from spreading further. Numerous countries, including France, Britain, Japan and South Korea, have already begun airlifting their citizens out of Wuhan.

There are many ways to do it, but I'd like you to start yourselves with such small steps to control it,\" said Koike.

As the death toll from the SARS-like pathogen sweeping the country continues to rise, shoppers have swamped pharmacies in search of \"Shuanghuanglian\". The rush came after influential state media outlet Xinhua reported Friday (Jan 31) that the esteemed Chinese Academy of Sciences had found the concoction \"can inhibit\" the virus. Videos shared online showed long lines of people in surgical masks lining up at night outside drug stores, purportedly in hope of snapping up the product, despite official advice that people avoid public gatherings to prevent infection. It quickly sold out both online and at brick-and-mortar stores, but responses to the remedy's supposed efficacy have ranged from enthusiasm to scepticism on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform. And state media sounded a more cautionary note on Saturday, with broadcaster CCTV publishing an interview with Zhang Boli, one of the researchers leading outbreak containment efforts, who warned of potential side effects from the medicine. The People's Daily newspaper, a government mouthpiece, said experts advised against taking traditional remedies without professional guidance. But the claim comes as Beijing looks to incorporate traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) into its nationwide fight against the virus, which has killed more than 300 people and infected over 14,000 in the country. On Sunday the Philippines reported the first death outside of China. Researchers at the state-run academy, a top government think tank, are also studying the potential use of a plant commonly known as Japanese knotweed to alleviate symptoms. The National Health Commission on Tuesday said TCM practitioners were among nearly 6,000 reinforcement medical personnel being sent to Wuhan in Hubei province, ground zero of the outbreak. The strategy has reignited fierce and long-running debate about the efficacy of TCM, which has a history going back 2,400 years and remains popular in modern-day China. Marc Freard, a member of the Chinese Medicine Academic Council of France, told AFP he believed traditional formulations could be used to treat people with symptoms ranging from fever to thick phlegm. But he warned that many remedies on the market were of questionable quality and admitted that TCM \"lacks scientific standards of efficacy\" because it relied on \"individualised treatment\". Traditional medicines were widely used in China in conjunction with Western methods during the 2003 epidemic of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed 774 people worldwide. But a 2012 study in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews found combining Chinese and Western medicines \"made no difference\" in battling the disease. The Chinese government has increasingly promoted traditional medicine abroad in recent years, often with nationalistic undertones. Beijing issued its first white paper on TCM in 2016, laying out plans to build medicine centres and dispatch practitioners to developing countries in Africa and Southeast Asia. President Xi Jinping has called TCM a \"treasure of Chinese civilisation\" and said at a meeting in October that it should be given as much weight as other treatments. China is \"working hard to spread the message internationally about its traditional culture\", and medicine is a part of this, Freard said. In 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) even added Chinese medicine to its \"International Classification of Diseases\" - a reference document for medical trends and global health statistics - after years of campaigning by Beijing. But the move was slammed by members of the scientific community, with the European Academies' Science Advisory Council calling the decision \"a major problem\" due to the lack of evidence-based practice. The WHO did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment. Fang Shimin, a prominent writer in China known for his campaigns against academic fraud, told AFP he believes the government's promotion of traditional medicine \"panders to nationalism and has nothing to do with science\". It is an enormous industry in China worth more than US$130 billion in 2016 - a third of the country's entire medical industry - according to state news agency Xinhua.","summary":"BEIJING: A claim by Chinese scientists that a liquid made with honeysuckle and flowering plants could help fight the deadly coronavirus has sparked frenzied buying of the traditional medicine, but doubts quickly emerged.

STB will also defray the cleaning costs of hotels that provided accommodation to the confirmed and suspected cases of the coronavirus infections. These schemes are the first steps in a wider set of measures to help tourism businesses \u201cmitigate the immediate impact\u201d of the coronavirus outbreak, STB added. These measures come after feedback from trade associations and chambers, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing. He said at the Oasia Hotel Downtown: \"I just want to assure the businesses and our workers that the survival of the businesses, and in the turn, the sustainability of the jobs for Singaporeans will be our primary focus.\" Oasia Hotel Downtown was where Singapore's 13th confirmed case of the Wuhan virus stayed prior to being tested positive for the coronavirus. The 73-year-old arrived in Singapore on Jan 21 and developed symptoms seven days later. Mr Chan told reporters that Singaporeans should be \"mentally prepared\" for the impact of the coronavirus to be \"wider, deeper and longer\" than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. This is because China's trade with Singapore and its GDP have both gone up four times since then. \"What we must be mentally prepared for is that the impact of any disruption to the Chinese economy, to the supply chains, is likely to be much wider, much deeper, because of the interlinkages with the global economy - certainly with the Singapore economy,\" he said. \"The tourism sector has already been directly affected by the novel coronavirus, due to a decline in visitor arrivals, especially from China,\" STB said in its media release on Sunday. Tourists from China account for about 20 per cent of Singapore\u2019s total international visitor arrivals, with about 3.6 million visitors to Singapore in 2019, the tourism board added. Earlier this week, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong announced wider travel restrictions to include all new visitors \u2013 regardless of nationality \u2013 with recent travel history to China. These visitors will also not be allowed to transit in Singapore, as part of restrictions that came into effect at 11.59pm on Saturday. Those with Chinese passports, with the exception of Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders, will also not be allowed to enter Singapore. All forms of new visas to Chinese passport holders have been suspended, and Singapore\u2019s status as a visa-free transit facility has also been suspended for those with Chinese passports. There have been 18 confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore. Of the 18, 16 are travellers from Wuhan and two are Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. The tourism board said hotels that provided accommodation to suspected and confirmed cases will get help with their environmental cleaning and disinfection costs. \u201cSTB will cover up to 50 per cent of third-party professional cleaning fees, capped at S$20,000 per establishment for hotels with confirmed cases; and S$10,000 per establishment for hotels with suspected cases,\u201d the board added. This will be backdated to Jan 23, when the first confirmed case in Singapore was detected. Licence fees for hotels for the rest of 2020 will also be waived by the Hotels Licensing Board. \u201cSimilarly, travel agents and tourist guides whose licences are due for renewal in 2020 will not need to pay to renew their licence fees,\u201d STB said. Chief executive of STB Keith Tan said: \"Over the past week, STB has been in close contact with our tourism partners to understand their difficulties and to assess the impact. \"We know the situation is likely to persist, and recognise we need to move quickly to support the industry and build confidence. \"STB will continue to identify targeted and effective ways to support the tourism industry so that they are well-positioned to grow swiftly once we start to recover.\" Full details of the overall package of relief measures will be announced at Budget 2020 on Feb 18. The Government is \"keenly aware\" that some front-line workers are \"particularly worried\" about coming into contact with unwell guests or customers, added Manpower Minister Josephine Teo. She said that the Singapore National Employers Federation and the Singapore Business Federation will issue an advisory to employers with such workers. \"(The advisory will explain) what they can do to provide these workers with support. They need guidance on how to deal with unwell customers, and the advisory will give some specific suggestions,\" she said. Workers who are placed on leave of absences are not unwell and should not be evicted by landlords, co-tenants or dormitory operators, added Mrs Teo. There have been reports of such evictions, Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran had said on Friday. \"There's really no need to do so. It is completely unhelpful. And this is a time where we actually need to provide care and support to each other,\" Mrs Teo said. She noted that placing workers on leave is an extra precaution to minimise social contact. \"We must always be mindful that even as we take these extra precautions, we should be supportive to the people who are affected by the leave of absence,\" she said.","summary":"SINGAPORE: Licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides will be waived as part of measures to help the tourism sector in Singapore that has been \u201cdirectly affected\u201d by the Wuhan coronavirus, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said on Sunday (Feb 2).

To support firms affected by the epidemic, the CSRC said companies that had expiring stock pledge agreements could apply for extensions with securities firms, and it would urge corporate bond investors to extend the maturity dates of debt. The CSRC is also considering launching hedging tools for the A-share market to help alleviate market panic and will suspend evening sessions of futures trading starting from Monday, it said. \"We believe that the successive introduction and implementation of policy measures will play a better role in improving market expectations and preventing irrational behavior,\" it told the People's Daily.

South Korea arranged this week to airlift hundreds of its citizens from Wuhan, which has been the centre of an outbreak that has claimed more than 300 lives in China and on Sunday the first victim overseas, in the Philippines. But Chinese regulations meant Chinese nationals like Kim's wife of three years could not leave, forcing the family to make a heartbreaking decision to stay together. Fears over his seven-month-old son's safety led Kim, 31, and his family to fly to South Korea briefly last month to get a flu vaccination in the hopes it would lessen the chances of infection. They returned to Wuhan just in time for the Chinese government to impose a lockdown on January 23, restricting travel out of the city. \"While in Korea, we had indeed thought about staying longer because of the virus but we had no idea it would become so serious, and we also have our business,\" Kim, who has run a Korean restaurant in Wuhan since 2015, told Reuters from the city. When South Korea announced the evacuation plans, joy gave way to disappointment when he realised they could not leave as a family. More than 700 South Koreans flew out of Wuhan on two flights last week, and will spend at least the next two weeks in precautionary isolation at government-run facilities in South Korea. But for at least 120 other South Korean residents of Wuhan, family and other ties meant leaving was out of the question, according to Jeong Tae-il, head of the South Korean community in Hubei Province, where Wuhan is located. Kim tried to be philosophical about not being evacuated. \"Yes, we were disappointed but it can't stay like this forever,\" Kim said. \"For my son, perhaps it's better we're here because he's too young to go through the isolation plans and sudden schedule change.\" The family has spent the last week holed up at home, surviving off stockpiled food and avoiding the outside world out of fear that their son could be infected. While Kim says he is well supplied, he fears they might run out of powdered milk for the baby if the lockdown is extended beyond February. \"I'm afraid to go out, not for myself but for him, because all of the hospitals are full and there's no way to get him treated if he gets sick from me,\" Kim said.","summary":"SEOUL: Kim Min-jun's elation at news that South Korea would evacuate its citizens from the epicentre of a virus epidemic in China quickly faded when he learned his Chinese wife would be unable to accompany him.

The sport will continue to work with its regional partner and local authorities to study the viability of potential alternative dates should the situation improve, the Formule E and FIA governing bodies said in statements on Sunday. The race had been scheduled for March 21 in the coastal resort in Hainan province. The outbreak of the flu-like virus has killed more than 300 people and infected more than 14,000 in China after it first emerged in Wuhan in Hubei province late last year. Formula E said the decision was made jointly with the governing FIA and the Chinese federation of automobile and motorcycle sports to ensure the health and safety of travelling staff, participants and spectators. The race would have been the sixth of the championship's 14 rounds, with Seoul in May and Jakarta in June now the only remaining Asian races. Formula E Champions DS Techeetah are Chinese owned. The move will put Formula One in the spotlight, with Shanghai due to host the Chinese Grand Prix on April 19 as the fourth round of what would be a record 22-race season. That race is a much bigger event than city-focused Formula E and would normally be expected to draw a weekend crowd of more than 100,000 and bring in fans from outside China. The sport's governing body last week said that it was monitoring the situation closely under the direction of medical commission president Professor Gerard Saillant. \"The FIA will evaluate the calendar of its forthcoming races and, if necessary, take any action required to help protect the global motorsport community and the wider public,\" it said. The outbreak has affected numerous international sports events in China. Among them was the world indoor athletics championships scheduled to be held in Nanjing over March 13-15, which have now been postponed until next year. Basketball, badminton and boxing qualifying tournaments for this year's Tokyo Olympics have also been postponed, rescheduled or moved, while an LPGA Tour golf tournament has been pushed back to next year.","summary":"The sport will continue to work with its regional partner and local authorities to study the viability of potential alternative dates should the situation improve, the Formule E and FIA governing bodies said in statements on Sunday.

Several measures were announced over the past week, including widening travel restrictions for new visitors who have recent travel history to mainland China. These measures are \"in the best interests of our community and society\", Mr Iswaran said. \"So our focus is to ensure, to the best of our ability, that the risk of a community spread in Singapore is minimised,\" he added. \"That is where our focus should be, resolutely.\" Mr Iswaran was responding to a question about the first death from the coronavirus outside China. Earlier Sunday, the Philippines reported that a 44-year-old man from Wuhan had died in a hospital in Manila after being tested positive for the coronavirus. As of Sunday, there are more than 14,000 confirmed cases worldwide. More than 300 people have died after contracting the virus. The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday confirmed two additional imported cases of the Wuhan coronavirus on Saturday, bringing the total number of cases here to 18. There is no evidence of community spread in Singapore, MOH said. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a Chinese New Year event by the West Coast Vista Residents' Committee, Mr Iswaran urged Singaporeans to remain calm. \"We are also counting on Singaporeans to cooperate with us, stay calm, get their information from the right sources, heed the advice that is being given, and to carry on with life as per normal to the best of our abilities,\" he said. \"If we come together, we will pull through this,\" the minister added. Mr Iswaran - who is a Member of Parliament for West Coast GRC - said while there is a \"clear healthcare challenge\", it was also a \"psychological and social challenge\". \"The response that we have seen from Singaporeans reinforces and attests to the character of our society - that we are a cohesive and resilient society,\" he said. He pointed to examples such as soldiers from the Singapore Armed Forces packing masks to be distributed to Singapore households, efforts from grassroots volunteers in reaching out to residents, and the \"disciplined and orderly manner\" in which residents collected their masks. Earlier this week, it was announced that every Singapore household would each receive four surgical masks. Thousands of masks were handed out at Community Centres (CCs) and Residents' Committee centres on Saturday. Speaking during a visit to a mask collection centre at Blangah Court CC, Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee said authorities had \"multiple layers of defence\" to rise to the public health challenge. \"But it takes the whole of community, the whole of society working close together, building trust with each other, and ensuring that in our society, there is that social compact, that one will take precautions (and) exercise social responsibility,\" he said. About 6 per cent of all households have collected their masks as of Saturday night, the minister added.","summary":"SINGAPORE: Singapore remains focused on \"minimising\" the risk of a community spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, said Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran on Sunday (Feb 2). \"So our focus is to ensure, to the best of our ability, that the risk of a community spread in Singapore is minimised,\" he added.

The travel bans have left many jittery. A 46-year-old American said she was worried her flight home would be cancelled at the eleventh hour. \"My only hope is that I can go home. I have been standing here checking the flight schedules for any changes,\" said the woman, who declined to give her name. \"I can't be sure until the last minute.\" Others, such as 22-year-old Jamie Bosch, are leaving because of work. \"We can't do anything, and everything is closed,\" said the English teacher. \"You can't see your friends. There's nothing to do, so I just decided to go home.\" Bosch, who is from South Africa, said she was worried if she did contract the virus, she would be isolated, with no family support. \"(My family) said I need to go home,\" she said, adding that she would return when school re-opens in March. Icaro Medeiros, 22, a student at Beijing's Central University of Finance and Economics, said his family cancelled their planned February visit to China after Beijing closed off tourist attractions such as the Great Wall and Forbidden City. \"I decided to leave Beijing because we are not sure when the semester will start again,\" he said. \"All of my friends have returned home, so there wasn't any reason for me to stay in Beijing alone.\" Chinese citizens too have seen their plans derailed. Wang Yulu, 46, was on her way to the airport with her daughter on Saturday when they learned that Australia had barred non-citizens arriving from China. Her daughter was due to begin a university semester in Australia, but the pair were forced to turn back to Changchun city in northeast China even before they arrived at the airport. \"It can't be helped, we won't be going,\" said Wang. They don't want us Chinese citizens there.\"","summary":"With businesses closed for at least another week, classes suspended and airlines cancelling flights, many foreign students and workers see no reason to stay in the country while it struggles with the viral epidemic. At Beijing's international airport on Sunday (Feb 2), the 19-year-old Uzbek student told AFP he was heading home because his parents were worried about the virus, which has claimed over 300 lives and infected more than 14,000 across China.

The number is less than one per cent of Singapore's workforce, according to the Manpower Ministry but it will affect some sectors more than others. The absences are likely to cause a small impact on individual companies, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said on Sunday (Feb 2), adding that her ministry is monitoring the situation. \"Our best estimate is that at the present moment, there are about 30,000 workpass holders of PRC nationality who have left Singapore but have not returned.\" Mrs Teo said told reporters on a visit to the Oasia Hotel Downtown with Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing. These workers make up less than 1 per cent of Singapore's workforce, she said. \"Of course that does not include Singaporeans who may also have a travel history, including China, and who upon return may be affected by the requirement to go on a leave of absence,\" she added. Manufacturing is more affected than services and construction, Mrs Teo said. \"In our interactions with the trade associations and chambers ... our understanding is that most companies are talking about one or two, fairly small numbers, manageable at the company level. \"But at the sector level, there could be some impact too, so we're working closely with these associations, and if there's a need to help them, we will certainly do so.\" Meanwhile, she says frontline staff may also be unsure on how to serve customers who are unwell during this period of time. She says the Singapore National Employers Federation and Singapore Business Federation will be sending out guidances on what employees can do when they encounter those who are unwell.","summary":"The number is less than one per cent of Singapore's workforce, according to the Manpower Ministry but it will affect some sectors more than others.
